<p>Just like last time, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I was surprised with how College Board decided to grade some of the categories and that their scoring different from mine at times. With this assignment, I think I learned a lot about the different categories College Board uses to grade the performance tasks. Also, I came to realize that it takes a lot of work to grade the performance tasks because one small error can result in a 0. This made it challenging to figure out whether the category should receive a 0 or a 1. With the 2 create performance task grading assignments I have completed, I have a greater understanding of what it takes to fulfill the requirements of each category and how selective College Board is with their grading.</p>

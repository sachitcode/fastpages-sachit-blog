            "title": "Notebook - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "NOTE . As you follow along, make sure to fill in the blanks and complete the coding exercises! . Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . For example, by storing a user&#39;s name and profile picture, the application can address the user by name and display their picture, creating a more personal experience. Activity logs can also be used to track user behavior and help the application recommend new features or improvements. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and responsibly, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build robust and user-friendly applications that meet the needs of your users. . For simplicity purposes, we will be lecturing on how one can store and manipulate user data for future utilization. . Here we go! . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . In the context of backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user related requests. . Creating a new user: . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: john_doe, Email: john@example.com . Lecture Topics: . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def init(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email . def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . Creating a new user: . python . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Here, we create a new User object, new_user, with a specified username and email. We then call the display_info method to display the user&#39;s information. . Using property decorators (getter and setter) . Property decorators allow developers to access and modify instance data more concisely. The @property decorator creates a getter method, while the @attribute.setter decorator creates a setter method. . Example: . class Employee: def __init__(self, employee_id, name): self._employee_id = employee_id self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Employee class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . In the context of backend functionality, this Employee class can be used to model employees within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage employee data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify employee information in a controlled way. . Usage: . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . John Doe Jane Doe . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method . employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . In the context of backend functionality, the getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . CHECK: Explain the function of getters and setters in your own words. . Getters are used to access an attribute of the class and setters are used to set the value of an attribute. . class Car: def __init__(self, make, model, year): self._make = make self._model = model self._year = year @property def make(self): return self._make @make.setter def make(self, new_make): self._make = new_make @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . Take notes here on property decorators and the purpose they serve: . There are setter @name.setter and getter @property methods | Property decorators are used to customize the properties of classes | They make it easier to access these properties | . Students can then practice creating instances of their Car class and using the getter and setter methods to access and modify the car attributes. . In the context of backend functionality, this Car class can be used to model cars within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage car data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify car information in a controlled way. . Overview . WE COVERED: In conclusion, we have covered essential concepts in object-oriented programming using Python, including: . Defining classes and creating objects Property decorators (getter and setter) Class methods and static methods Inheritance and method overriding Working with multiple objects and class attributes . These concepts provide a solid foundation for understanding how to model real-world entities using classes and objects in Python. By learning to work with classes, objects, and their methods, students can develop more efficient and modular code. . As students become more comfortable with these concepts, they can explore more advanced topics, such as multiple inheritance, abstract classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Additionally, they can apply these principles to practical projects like web development with Flask and SQLite, as discussed earlier. . Overall, mastering object-oriented programming will greatly enhance students&#39; ability to develop complex and maintainable software systems. . Databases and SQlite . SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is embedded within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite a great choice for small-scale applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t want to set up a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, which provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. By the end of this lesson, you&#39;ll have a good understanding of how to work with SQLite databases in Flask and be ready to start building your own applications. . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . One of the key features of Flask is its ability to work seamlessly with databases, including SQLite. A database is a collection of data stored in an organized manner that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. . SQlite database in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;example.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE example_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Basic SQL commands (create, read, update, delete) . SQL is really useful because it helps people do a bunch of things with the data stored in databases. For example, they can use it to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . CRUD is an acronym that stands for the fundamental operations that can be performed on a database, which are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. A widely-used lightweight database management system is SQLite, which can be easily integrated with different programming languages. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command . | . Take notes here on the basic components of SQL: . import sqlite3 def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . This block of code is a menu function that helps with create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks and displays the schema. The menu function acts as a control point that directs the program to call different functions based on what the user wants to do. When users enter their preferred action, the input is checked to see which function to use. The menu function is created with no arguments and is called repeatedly, displaying the menu options until the user decides to leave. . Creating a Database . import sqlite3 def create_database(): # Connect to the database (will create it if it doesn&#39;t exist) connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Create the professors table if it doesn&#39;t already exist cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS professors ( name TEXT, field TEXT, rating REAL, reviews TEXT )&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit changes and close the connection connection.commit() connection.close() # Call the function to create the database create_database() . Create Function: . import sqlite3 def create(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; name = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s name: &quot;) field = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s field of expertise: &quot;) rating = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s rating (out of 10): &quot;) reviews = input(&quot;Enter any reviews or comments about the professor: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO professors (name, field, rating, reviews) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, field, rating, reviews)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been added to the list of coding professors.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . Bob Smith has been added to the list of coding professors. . The create() function allows users to input information about a coding professor and store it in a SQLite database named &#39;professors.db&#39;. This script prompts the user for the professor&#39;s name, field of expertise, rating out of 10, and any reviews or comments about the professor. It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . Read Function . import sqlite3 def read(): try: # Open a connection to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all records from the professors table cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors&quot;) rows = cursor.fetchall() # If there are any records, print them if len(rows) &gt; 0: print(&quot;List of coding professors:&quot;) for row in rows: print(f&quot;Name: {row[0]} nField of expertise: {row[1]} nRating: {row[2]} nReviews: {row[3]} n&quot;) else: print(&quot;There are no coding professors in the list.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while connecting to the database:&quot;, error) finally: # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() read() . List of coding professors: Name: Bob Smith Field of expertise: Mathematics Rating: 8.0 Reviews: My favorite professor! . This code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using Python and the sqlite3 library. The first step is to establish a connection to the database and create a cursor object to execute SQL commands. Then, a SELECT query is executed to fetch all records from the &quot;professors&quot; table. If there are any records, the code iterates through each record and prints out the name, field of expertise, rating, and reviews for each coding professor. If there are no records in the table, a message indicating so is printed. . Update Function . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Get the professor&#39;s name to update name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor to update: &quot;) # Retrieve the current record from the database cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) record = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor is found, update the record if record: print(&quot;Enter the new information for the professor:&quot;) field = input(f&quot;Current field: {record[1]} nNew field: &quot;) rating = input(f&quot;Current rating: {record[2]} nNew rating: &quot;) reviews = input(f&quot;Current reviews: {record[3]} nNew reviews: &quot;) # Execute SQL to update the record cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE professors SET field=?, rating=?, reviews=? WHERE name=?&quot;, (field, rating, reviews, name)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name}&#39;s record has been updated.&quot;) # If the professor is not found, notify the user else: print(f&quot;No record found for {name}.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while updating record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update () . Enter the new information for the professor: Bob Smith&#39;s record has been updated. . This is an implementation of an update function for the professors database using the sqlite3 module in Python. The function first establishes a connection to the database file &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; and creates a cursor object to execute SQL commands. It prompts the user to enter the name of the professor to update and retrieves the corresponding record from the database using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to match the professor&#39;s name. If the professor is found in the database, the user is prompted to enter new information for the professor&#39;s field of expertise, rating, and reviews. The function then executes an UPDATE statement with the new information to update the record in the database. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): # Connect to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Prompt the user for the name of the professor to delete name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor you want to delete: &quot;) # Use a SQL query to find the professor with the given name cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) row = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor exists, confirm deletion and delete the record if row: confirm = input(f&quot;Are you sure you want to delete {name}? (y/n): &quot;) if confirm.lower() == &#39;y&#39;: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been deleted from the list of coding professors.&quot;) else: print(f&quot;{name} not found in the list of coding professors.&quot;) # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . Bob Smith has been deleted from the list of coding professors. . This code is a Python function for deleting a record from a SQLite database. The function prompts the user to input the name of the professor they want to delete. It then uses a SQL query to search for the professor in the database. If the professor is found, the user is prompted to confirm the deletion. If the user confirms, the function executes a SQL command to delete the record from the database. The function also prints a message confirming that the professor has been deleted from the list of coding professors. If the professor is not found in the database, the function prints a message indicating that the professor is not in the list. . Our Project ... in the works . SAM Messaging System .

AP Exam: 1,2,3,4 etc. | Python: 0,1,2,3 etc. | . | . How do lists Manage Complexity of a program? . We may not need as many variables. For example: One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student | There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time | . | . Answer the following questions about the code block below: . Why do you think lists are helpful? What word does College Board like to use to describe the function of lists? | . Lists are helpful as they allow you to store many values in one variable. They can also be used to categorize values into groups. The word College Board uses to describe the function of lists is abstraction. . # variable of type string name = &quot;Sri Kotturi&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;, &quot;html&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[2]&quot;, langs[2], type(langs[2])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 16 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[2] Java &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Sri Kotturi&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . Mathematical Expressions . What is the output of the cell below? What Mathematical Expressions do you see being used? (List them below.) . The output is the average of the 2 grades (which are both equal to 10) -&gt; output of 10 | Some mathematical expressions I see being used are addition (to combine both grade values) and division to divide by the number of grades (2 in this case) | . grade1 = 10 grade2 = grade1 average_grade = (grade1 + grade2) // 2 #what are these two slashes?: This results in the output being rounded to the nearest whole number print(average_grade) . 10 . What is the value of num1, num2, and num3? Explain how each number ended up what it was. . num1 is first set to the value of 2 but is later set to the values of 4^6 which is | num3 is set to the value of the remainder of num1 divided by 5 (num1 being 4^6 or 4096) | num2 is set to the value of num1 + num3 divided by 9 to the nearest whole number | . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 ** num3 num3 = num1 % 5 num2 = (num1 + num3) // 9 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . 4096 455 1 . Selection . Selection refers to the process of making decisions in a program based on certain conditions. It is normally done with conditional statements. . Conditionals . What is a conditional?: . Statement that allows code to execute different instructions if a certain condition is true or false | Allows program to make decisions based on data and input | . What are the main types of conditional statements?: . if | elif | else | . If statements . The if statement is used to check if a certain condition is true. The condition can be any expression that evaulates to a boolean value, True or False. If the condition is True, then it executes a code block. | If (condition) then (consequence) | Example: | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met . x is positive . Else . The else statemnt executes a code block when the if condition is False. | If (condition) then (consequence A), else (consequence B) | . Elif . The elif statement can check multiple conditions in a sequence, and execute a certain block of code if any of the conditions are true. | If (condition) then (consequence A), elif (condition) then (consequence B), else (consequence C) . | Example adding onto the code from before to take negative numbers and 0 into account . | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met elif x &lt; 0: # if previous condition not true... elif condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is negative&quot;)# code that will execute if condition is met else: # everything else, in this case it is if x == 0 print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) # only executes if all previous conditions are not met . x is negative . Nested Conditionals . What is a nested conditional?: . Conditional statement inside another conditional statement | Allows to check for more complex condition where one condition depends on another | . Nested Conditional Statements . Example: | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(&quot;x is even divisible by 2&quot;) # only ever checks is x is divisble by 3 if x is even. nested conditional if x % 3 == 0: print(&quot;x is divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is odd&quot;) . x is odd . Indentation . When using conditionals and nested conditionals in Python, it is important to pay attention to the level of indentation in the code. The code inside the if, elif, and else blocks must be indented so they are nested within the outer statements. This way, Python knows which code belongs to which block. . Binary Search . What is binary search and what is it used for?: . Searching algorithm | Find and select a specific element in a sorted list of elements | One of the fastest ways to find a values from an ordered list as each repetition reduces the size of the possible values of the list by half | . How does binary search work?: . Repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the middle element and compares the middle value to the target value, if not the same then it continues on to either the lower or upper half | Eliminate half of the remaining search interval elements each time | Efficient way to search for element in large dataset | . What is the time complexity and why?: . O(log(N)) | The maximum number of iterations is the amount of times the list can be divided in half until it reaches 1 number | Dividing by 2, so it is log2(N), logarigthm of n base 2 . | You may recognize the example below from the binary lesson last Friday . | . import random def binary_search_game(): low = 1 high = 100 target = random.randint(low, high) while True: guess = (low + high) // 2 print(f&quot;Is your number {guess}?&quot;) response = input(&quot;Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: &quot;) # conditional statements to check target number and guess if response == &#39;yes&#39;: print(f&quot;I guessed your number {guess}!&quot;) break elif response == &#39;higher&#39;: low = guess + 1 elif response == &#39;lower&#39;: high = guess - 1 else: print(&quot;Invalid input, please enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;.&quot;) binary_search_game() . Is your number 50? Is your number 25? I guessed your number 25! . Quick Hack . Write a program using conditionals and nested conditionals . Ideas: Quiz, game (rock paper scissors, guess number), etc | . # Number Guessing Game: import random randomNumber = random.randint(1,100) numNotGuessed = True play = input(&quot;Do you want to play a number guessing game? (y/n)&quot;) if play == &quot;y&quot;: while numNotGuessed: guess = int(input(&quot;Guess the number (Number is between 1 and 100 inclusive)&quot;)) if guess &lt; randomNumber: print(str(guess) + &quot; is too low. Guess again!&quot;) elif guess &gt; randomNumber: print(str(guess) + &quot; is too high. Guess again!&quot;) elif guess == randomNumber: print(&quot;You win! &quot; + str(guess) + &quot; is the correct number!&quot;) numNotGuessed = False else: print(&quot;No worries! You can play the game whenever you are ready!&quot;) . 46 is too high. Guess again! 21 is too low. Guess again! 35 is too low. Guess again! You win! 40 is the correct number! . Introduction to Algorithms . an algorithm is a set of instructions that describes how to solve a problem or perform a specific task using a computer program. | It is a precise sequence of computational steps that take an input and produce an output | . How do Algorithms relate to data structures? . Algorithms often rely on specific data structures to solve problems efficiently. | Sorting algorithms require a data structure such as an array or a linked list to store and manipulate data. | Searching algorithms such as binary search require data structures like arrays or trees to organize and search through data. | . Important Terms . What is an algorithm? . it is a finite set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task | . Sequencing . means that there is an order in which to do things | . Selection . Helps to choose two different outcomes based off of a decision that the programmer wants to make | . Iteration . Repeat something until the condition is met. (also referred to as repetition) | . Calling and Developing Procedures . A procedure is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task. | To call a procedure, you need to know its name and any arguments it requires. | When a procedure is called, the program jumps to its instruction and starts executing it. | The arguments passed to a procedure can be used within the procedure to perform tasks or calculations. | After the procedure has completed its task, it returns control back to the calling program. | . def add_numbers(a, b): sum = a + b print(&quot;The sum of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;is&quot;, sum) # Call the procedure with arguments 5 and 7 add_numbers(5, 7) . The sum of 5 and 7 is 12 . The result of the procedure can be stored in a variable, printed to the screen, or used in any other way that is required by the program. | Procedures can be defined within the same program or in external files, and can be reused across multiple parts of the program. | To avoid errors and improve code readability, it&#39;s important to define and call procedures with proper syntax and conventions that are appropriate for the programming language you&#39;re using. | . def calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) average = total / count return average # Call the procedure with a list of numbers numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] result = calculate_average(numbers_list) # Display the result print(&quot;The average of&quot;, numbers_list, &quot;is&quot;, result) . The average of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] is 30.0 . Algorithmic Efficiency . Algorithmic efficiency refers to the amount of time and resources needed to execute an algorithm. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its time complexity and space complexity. . Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Can be analyzed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm. | . | What is the time complexity of the following code: . O(N) | O(N*log(N)) | O(N * Sqrt(N)) | O(N*N) | . | The time complexity is O(N*N) because there are nested for for loops which each iterate N times. . | . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i, N)): a = a + i + j . What will be the time complexity of the following code? . n | (n+1) | n(n-1) | n(n+1) . | The time complexity is n(n-1) because the inner loop takes less time to run through. . | . value = 0 for i in range(n): #iterates &quot;n&quot; times, with &quot;i&quot; taking on values from 0 to n-1. for j in range(i): # iterates &quot;i&quot; times, with &quot;j&quot; taking on values from 0 to i-1. value=value+1 . Efficiency can be improved by optimizing algorithms or by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. Some common techniques for improving efficiency include reducing the size of input data, caching results, and parallelizing tasks. | Understanding algorithmic efficiency is important in software development, as it can impact the performance of applications and their ability to scale with larger data sets. | . | . Iteration and Simulations . Simulations are models of real-world phenomena or systems that use mathematical algorithms and computer programs simulate the real behavior and aspects of the subject being modeled. . Simulations are most often used to model complex or time-consuming things that would be difficult to test in real life, such as modeling the spread of diseases in certain ecosystems or testing the functionality of a potential product before it is made. . In this lesson, we will be looking at lists, iteration, and random values through the lens of simulations. . PLEASE RUN THE CODE BELOW BEFORE INTERACTING WITH THE CODE SEGMENTS IN THIS SECTION! . class Card: def __init__(self, suit, val): self.suit = suit self.val = val if val == 11: self.kind = &quot;Ace&quot; elif val == 12: self.kind = &quot;Jack&quot; elif val == 13: self.kind = &quot;Queen&quot; elif val == 14: self.kind = &quot;King&quot; else: self.kind = str(self.val) #return a formatted string version of a card def show(self): return f&quot;{self.kind} of {self.suit}&quot; #adjust aces to prevent breaking def ace_adj(self): if self.kind == &quot;Ace&quot;: self.val = 1 . Review: Lists and Iteration . Lists and iteration work hand-in-hand to efficiently process and/or modify multiple values at once. In a card game, for example, lists and iteration are used together frequently to make the game work correctly. . For Loops . For loops are probably the most well-known type of iterative loop used in code. Most of us know about the for variable in list format. . One helpful tool not a lot of people know about is the enumerate() function. When used in conjunction with a for loop, you can always have access to the index and value of each selected list entry. . numlist = [3, 5, 68, 203] for key, num in enumerate(numlist): print(f&quot;This entry&#39;s index is {str(key)}, but its value is {str(num)}.&quot;) print(f&quot;The difference between the value and the index is {num - key}.&quot;) . This entry&#39;s index is 0, but its value is 3. The difference between the value and the index is 3. This entry&#39;s index is 1, but its value is 5. The difference between the value and the index is 4. This entry&#39;s index is 2, but its value is 68. The difference between the value and the index is 66. This entry&#39;s index is 3, but its value is 203. The difference between the value and the index is 200. . QUESTION: How is the key, num in enumerate(list) format similar to the format used when applying a for loop to a dictionary? . Answer: The key, num in enumerate(list) goes through the elements of a list and access the elements index and value. This is similar to a for loop iterating through a dictionary as a dictionary also has keys with corresponding values. . List Comprehension . You may also see for loops used within a list like below. We went over this in class fairly recently. In this case, it is used to show the cards in the hand of a player. . player_hand = [] # the player&#39;s hand is represented as a list # because lists are mutable (can change), they can be added to, like drawing a card # assume the deck below is a a deck of shuffled cards deck = [Card(&quot;Hearts&quot;, 3), Card(&quot;Spades&quot;, 12), Card(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, 11)] def draw_card(hand, deck): hand.append(deck.pop()) #try it out draw_card(player_hand, deck) print([card.show() for card in player_hand]) . [&#39;Ace of Diamonds&#39;] . Recursive Loops . Recursive loops have you calling one function inside of another. If a function must make some change to a certain value multiple times, it is oftem most efficient to have a function call itself with slightly different arguments like the fibonacci sequence below. . def fibonacci(terms): if terms &lt;= 1: return terms return fibonacci(terms-1) + fibonacci(terms-2) fibonacci(10) . 55 . Nesting Loops . Nesting loops increases the time complexity of the program, but it can be used to do things like make a card deck (see below). . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): #HINT: try replacing this function deck.append(Card(suit, val)) . While Loops . While loops aren&#39;t used in the program, but they offer a different way to repeat a set of instructions in a program. The procedure below the while [condition] line will occur until the condition is made not true. . Student Interaction: How could this build function be altered to function with a while loop within it? . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): deck.append(Card(suit, val)) #HINT: you may want to make an incrementing i variable . While loops also alter an alternative way to loop a set of instructions forever, until a precise thing occurs to break the loop. See the code below. . import random i = 0 while True: i += 1 ch = random.randint(1, 11) if ch == 10: print(f&quot;It took {str(i)} random generations to get 10.&quot;) break . It took 37 random generations to get 10. . 49 random generations is a lot more than it would normally take, but it&#39;s important for code to be able to model unlikely, yet possible scenarios. Speaking of random values... . Random Values . Because unpredictable randomness occurs in the real world, it&#39;s important to have a way to represent it. Simulations are able to use randomization, which could be in the form of random number generation or other methods like shuffle. . Card decks are a great example of how random values can be used to represent real-world scenarios. In the card simulation, the random module&#39;s shuffle function is used to quite literally shuffle the deck, seen below. . def shuffle(deck): random.shuffle(deck) . Often, random selection methods use functions like randint or randrange as ways to select certain indexes in lists, or might use the random numbers in some other way. . QUESTION: Without shuffling the card order of the deck, can you think of a way that the aforementioned random module functions could be used to get a random card from the deck? Do so in the code cell below. . import random suits = [&quot;Hearts&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Spades&quot;] ranks = [&quot;Ace&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;King&quot;] suitChoice = random.choice(suits) rankChoice = random.choice(ranks) card = &quot;&quot; card = card + rankChoice + &quot; of &quot; + suitChoice print(card) . 7 of Spades . Simulation Homework . Now that you&#39;ve learned about simulations and how they&#39;re used, it&#39;s time to apply that knowledge by creating a (basic) simulation of a real-world scenario. It can be something in nature, like the changes in the wildlife population of a certain area; it can be a game, like Uno (no blackjack though, that&#39;s taken); or it can be something completely random and unique. . The simulation must include... . Use of at least one random value | At least one list or similar data type (dictionary, set, etc.) | Efficient use of iteration (must support the purpose of the simualtion) | Selection (use of conditionals) | . Do this in your student copy in the cell provided. This is worth 0.9 (or more with extra credit) out of the 3 possible points. . # (Concert attendance? Wind speeds? Interactions between subjects in large environments?) # Think about the sort of things that could be saved in lists, dictionaries, etc. # (Even better if you can take advantage of the specific features of multiple types of data sets!) # What kind of iteration happens in the real world? # What occurs repeatedly, even over a long period of time? # You could model the results of a disease spreading through a population without it taking IRL years. # Dice Rolling Simulation import random numberOfRolls = 0 invalidInput = True roll1 = 0 roll2 = 0 roll3 = 0 roll4 = 0 roll5 = 0 roll6 = 0 while invalidInput: # verifies that the user&#39;s input is in fact an integer prompt = input(&quot;How many times do you want the dice to be rolled?&quot;) if prompt.isdigit(): numberOfRolls = int(prompt) invalidInput = False else: print(&quot;&#39;&quot; + prompt + &quot;&#39; is not a valid input. Please enter an integer. n&quot;) rolls = [] # All rolls are stored in this list for i in range(numberOfRolls): # Rolls are randomly generated and stored in the list &#39;diceRoll&#39; diceRoll = random.randint(1,6) rolls.append(diceRoll) for i in rolls: # Setting the values of the number of times each number was rolled to different variables if i == 1: roll1 = roll1 + 1 if i == 2: roll2 = roll2 + 1 if i == 3: roll3 = roll3 + 1 if i == 4: roll4 = roll4 + 1 if i == 5: roll5 = roll5 + 1 if i == 6: roll6 = roll6 + 1 print(&quot;The dice was rolled &quot; + str(numberOfRolls) + &quot; times. n&quot;) print(&quot;The number 1 was rolled &quot; + str(roll1) + &quot; times.&quot;) print(&quot;The number 2 was rolled &quot; + str(roll2) + &quot; times.&quot;) print(&quot;The number 3 was rolled &quot; + str(roll3) + &quot; times.&quot;) print(&quot;The number 4 was rolled &quot; + str(roll4) + &quot; times.&quot;) print(&quot;The number 5 was rolled &quot; + str(roll5) + &quot; times.&quot;) print(&quot;The number 6 was rolled &quot; + str(roll6) + &quot; times.&quot;) . &#39;alsdjflksdjf&#39; is not a valid input. Please enter an integer. The dice was rolled 10000 times. The number 1 was rolled 1710 times. The number 2 was rolled 1686 times. The number 3 was rolled 1661 times. The number 4 was rolled 1601 times. The number 5 was rolled 1659 times. The number 6 was rolled 1683 times. . Databases . We have already gone over databases in this class, but here is a refresher. A database contains data that&#39;s stored in columns and rows. The information in this database can then be pulled from the database and can be used in a program. . Setting Up the Database . Run the code cell below to prepare SQLite to create the database. If your system is struggling with the flask functions, verify that you&#39;re in the correct Python environment. REMEMBER: You should only db.init_app(app) ONCE during the process! . from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) . The Model File . The model file plays a crucial role in the formation of the database. . The model helps to create new databases | It provides a standardized method for formating the database entries across different systems | Objects used within the database are created | . import os, base64 import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table class User(db.Model): __tablename__ = &#39;players&#39; # table name is plural, class name is singular # Define the User schema with &quot;vars&quot; from object id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) _username = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) _streak = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes the instance variables within object (self) def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._streak = streak # a username getter method, extracts username from object @property def username(self): return self._username # a setter function, allows username to be updated after initial object creation @username.setter def username(self, username): self._username = username # a getter method, extracts streak from object @property def streak(self): return self._streak # a setter function, allows streak to be updated after initial object creation @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak # output content using str(object) in human readable form, uses getter # output content using json dumps, this is ready for API response def __str__(self): return json.dumps(self.read()) # CRUD create/add a new record to the table # returns self or None on error def create(self): try: # creates a person object from User(db.Model) class, passes initializers db.session.add(self) # add prepares to persist person object to Users table db.session.commit() # SqlAlchemy &quot;unit of work pattern&quot; requires a manual commit return self except IntegrityError: db.session.remove() return None # CRUD read converts self to dictionary # returns dictionary def read(self): return { &quot;id&quot;: self.id, &quot;username&quot;: self.username, &quot;streak&quot;: self.streak } # CRUD update: updates user name, password, phone # returns self def update(self, username, streak): &quot;&quot;&quot;only updates values with length&quot;&quot;&quot; if len(username) &gt; 0: self.username = username if streak &gt; 0: self.streak = streak db.session.commit() return self # CRUD delete: remove self # None def delete(self): db.session.delete(self) db.session.commit() return None &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; # Builds working data for testing def initUsers(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = User(username=&quot;Mr. Cards&quot;, streak=5) u2 = User(username=&quot;Kard Kowntre&quot;, streak=10) u3 = User(username=&quot;Un Bea Table&quot;, streak=15) users = [u1, u2, u3] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: user.create() print(f&#39;Created user with username &quot;{user.username}&quot;.&#39;) except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {user.username}&quot;) . The init Fuction . The init method has one purpose which is to initialize the object&#39;s attributes. This is what is known as the constructor. In our project, the init method initalizes the username and streak as variables. . def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._score = streak . Setters and Getters . Setters and Getters are important methods used when writing code for databases. . Setter: a method that allows us to set or change the value of an attribute in a class. | Getter: a method that allows us to access an attribute in a given class. | . Setter Example . @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak . Getter Example . @property def streak(self): return self._streak . The Api File . An API is an important part of having a functional database. . it acts as a messenger that allows programs to access data from the others | it connects all information | for a database, an api retrieves the data requested in code for the user | . import json from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building user_api = Blueprint(&#39;user_api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/users&#39;) api = Api(user_api) class UserAPI: class _CRUD(Resource): # User API operation for Create, Read. THe Update, Delete methods need to be implemeented def post(self): # Create method &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate name username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) if username is None or len(username) &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Username is missing, or is less than a character&#39;}, 400 # validate uid streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) if streak is None or streak &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Streak is missing, or is less than 1&#39;}, 400 &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = User(username=username, streak=streak) &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create user in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of user if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {username}, either a format error or a duplicate&#39;}, 400 def get(self): # Read Method users = User.query.all() # read/extract all users from database json_ready = [user.read() for user in users] # prepare output in json return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, more specific to APIs than json.dumps def put(self): body = request.get_json() # get the body of the request id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) # get the UID (Know what to reference) user = User.query.get(id) # get the player (using the uid in this case) user.update(username=username, streak=streak) return f&quot;{user.read()} Updated&quot; def delete(self): body = request.get_json() id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) player = User.query.get(id) player.delete() return f&quot;{player.read()} Has been deleted&quot; # building RESTapi endpoint api.add_resource(_CRUD, &#39;/&#39;) . This is important particularly in a full flask respository context, but in this case, you&#39;ll just need to run the initUsers() function. . initUsers() . An Alternative Method of Making SQLite Databases . In a previous lesson, we went over using the cursor object in SQLite3. Rather than go over all of that here, this lesson goes over it thoroughly. (You may use this method for the homework below.) . Database Homework . For this assignment, we&#39;d like you to make your own database file as instructed above. Remember, the API file isn&#39;t necessary in this case; you&#39;ll be focusing on making the model and the init function. . Your database must include these things: . A class with at least four attributes (if not the cursor method) | Setters and getters for this class (if not the cursor method) | Each of the CRUD functions | An init function with at least four entries | A screenshot showing proof that your SQLite file has been created correctly | . Feel free to base your database on the model provided above! Ask our group if you have any questions or concerns. . import sqlite3 def create_database(): # Connect to the database (will create it if it doesn&#39;t exist) connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/subjects.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Create the subjects table if it doesn&#39;t already exist cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subjects ( subject TEXT, teacher TEXT, rating REAL, difficulty TEXT )&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit changes and close the connection connection.commit() connection.close() # Call the function to create the database create_database() def create(): database = &#39;instance/subjects.db&#39; subject = input(&quot;Enter the subject: &quot;) teacher = input(&quot;Enter the teacher who teaches this subject: &quot;) rating = input(&quot;How would you rate this subject (1 - 10): &quot;) difficulty = input(&quot;Enter how you would rate this subject&#39;s difficulty: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO subjects (subject, teacher, rating, difficulty) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (subject, teacher, rating, difficulty)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{subject} has been added to the list of subjects.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . Humanities has been added to the list of subjects. . Proof of Database . Grading . Your submission will be graded based on the following criteria: . Filling in the blank throughout the lesson and providing code in the given cells when applicable (0.9) | Simulation homework (0.9) | Database homework (0.9) | . Here are some ideas for ways to increase your score above a 2.7: . Make a frontend version of your simulation that can be interacted with on your blog | Connect your simulation to the database you create | Create a menu that allows a user to make an entry in your database (CRUD functions within it) | You can establish a relationship between two classes/tables in your database (see the relationship between the User and Note classes in the Nighthawk Coders flask repository) | .",

            "title": "Petite Pandas Data Analysis using Pandas and NumPy",
            "content": "Predictive Analysis . Predictive analysis is the use of statistical, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future events or behaviors. It involves identifying patterns and trends in data, and then using that information to forecast what is likely to happen in the future. . Predictive analysis is used in a wide range of applications, from forecasting sales and demand, to predicting customer behavior, to detecting fraudulent transactions. It involves collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including historical data, customer data, financial data, and social media data, among others. . The process of predictive analysis typically involves the following steps: . Defining the problem and identifying the relevant data sources | Collecting and cleaning the data | Exploring and analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends | Selecting an appropriate model or algorithm to use for predictions | Training and validating the model using historical data | Using the model to make predictions on new data | Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the model over time | Predictive analysis can help organizations make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage by leveraging insights from data. . It is most commonly used in Retail, where workers try to predict which products would be most popular and try to advertise those products as much as possible, and also Healthcare, where algorithms analyze patterns and reveal prerequisites for diseases and suggest preventive treatment, predict the results of various treatments and choose the best option for each patient individually, and predict disease outbreaks and epidemics. . 1. Intro to NumPy and the features it consists . Numpy, by definition, is the fundamental package for scientific in Python which can be used to perform mathematical operations, provides multidimensional array objects, and makes data analysis much easier. Numpy is very important and useful when it comes to data analysis, as it can easily use its features to complete and perform any mathematical operation, as well as analyze data files. . If you don&#39;t already have numpy installed, you can do so using conda install numpy or pip install numpy . Once that is complete, to import numpy in your code, all you must do is: . import numpy as np . 2. Using NumPy to create arrays . An array is the central data structure of the NumPy library. They are used as containers which are able to store more than one item at the same time. Using the function np.array is used to create an array, in which you can create multidimensional arrays. . Shown below is how to create a 1D array: . a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) print(a) # this creates a 1D array . [1 2 3] . How could you create a 3D array based on knowing how to make a 1D array? . array = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]]) print(array) . [[[1 2 3] [1 2 3] [1 2 3]]] . Arrays can be printed in different ways, especially a more readable format. As we have seen, arrays are printed in rows and columns, but we can change that by using the reshape function . c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) print(c.reshape(1, 9)) # organizes it all in a single line of output . [[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]] . In the code segment below, we can also specially select certain rows and columns from the array to further analyze selective data. . print(c[1:, :2]) # the 1: means &quot;start at row 1 and select all the remaining rows&quot; # the :2 means &quot;select the first two columns&quot; # prints from second 2 rows (1:) and last 2 columns (:2) . [[4 5] [7 8]] . 3. Basic array operations . One of the most basic operations that can be performed on arrays is arithmetic operations. With numpy, it is very easy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays. You can add, subtract, multiply and divide arrays, just like you would with regular numbers. When performing these operations, numpy applies the operation element-wise, meaning that it performs the operation on each element in the array separately. This makes it easy to perform operations on large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. . a = np.array([1, 2, 3]) b = np.array([4, 5, 6]) print(a + b) # adds each value based on the column the integer is in print(a - b) # subtracts each value based on the column the integer is in print(a * b) # multiplies each value based on the column the integer is in print(a / b) # divides each value based on the column the integer is in . [5 7 9] [-3 -3 -3] [ 4 10 18] [0.25 0.4 0.5 ] . d = np.exp(b) e = np.sqrt(b) print(d) print(e) . [ 54.59815003 148.4131591 403.42879349] [2. 2.23606798 2.44948974] . From the knowledge of how to use more advanced mathematical expressions than the basic 4 mathematical operations such as exponent and square root, now can you code how to calculate the 3 main trig expressions (sin, cos, tan), natural log, and log10 of a 1D array. . # calculate sin sin = np.sin(0) print(sin) # calculate cos cos = np.cos(0) print(cos) # calculate tan tan = np.tan(0) print(tan) # calculate natural log log = np.log(1) print(log) # calculate log10 log = np.log10(100) print(log) . 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 . 4. Data analysis using numpy . Numpy provides a convenient and powerful way to perform data analysis tasks on large datasets. One of the most common tasks in data analysis is finding the mean, median, and standard deviation of a dataset. Numpy provides functions to perform these operations quickly and easily. The mean function calculates the average value of the data, while the median function calculates the middle value in the data. The standard deviation function calculates how spread out the data is from the mean. Additionally, numpy provides functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the data. These functions are very useful for gaining insight into the properties of large datasets and can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks. . data = np.array([2, 5, 12, 13, 19]) print(np.mean(data)) # finds the mean of the dataset print(np.median(data)) # finds the median of the dataset print(np.std(data)) # finds the standard deviation of the dataset print(np.min(data)) # finds the min of the dataset print(np.max(data)) # finds the max of the dataset . 10.2 12.0 6.04648658313239 2 19 . Now from learning this, can you find a different way from how we can solve the sum or products of a dataset other than how we learned before? . # Sum of a dataset: # The mean of a dataset x the number of elements = the sum of the dataset sum = np.mean(data) * len(data) print(&quot;Sum: &quot; + str(sum)) # Product of a dataset: product = np.product(data) print(&quot;Product: &quot; + str(product)) . Sum: 51.0 Product: 29640 . Numpy also has the ability to handle CSV files, which are commonly used to store and exchange large datasets. By importing CSV files into numpy arrays, we can easily perform complex operations and analysis on the data, making numpy an essential tool for data scientists and researchers. . genfromtxt and loadtxt are two functions in the numpy library that can be used to read data from text files, including CSV files. . genfromtxt is a more advanced function that can be used to read text files that have more complex structures, including CSV files. genfromtxt can handle files that have missing or invalid data, or files that have columns of different data types. It can also be used to skip header lines or to read only specific columns from the file. . import numpy as np padres = np.genfromtxt(&#39;files/padres.csv&#39;, delimiter=&#39;,&#39;, dtype=str, encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) # delimiter indicates that the data is separated into columns which is distinguished by commas # genfromtxt is used to read the csv file itself # dtype is used to have numpy automatically detect the data type in the csv file print(padres) .

Pandas . What is Pandas . Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. A python library is something It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. . Why Use Pandas? . Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories. Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Also it is a part of data analysis, and data manipulation. . What Can Pandas Do? . Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like: . Is there a correlation between two or more columns? | What is average value | Max value | Min value | How to load data | Delete data | Sort Data. | . Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data. . Basics of Pandas. . import pandas as pd # What this does is it calls the python pandas library and this code segment is needed whenever incorporating pandas. . DICTIONARIES AND DATASETS . One way you are able to manipulate a pandas data set is by creating a dictionary and calling it as seen with the dict data 1 and pd.dataframe which is a way to print the set. | . import pandas as pd data1 = { &#39;teams&#39;: [&quot;BARCA&quot;, &quot;REAL&quot;, &quot;ATLETICO&quot;], &#39;standings&#39;: [1, 2, 3] } myvar = pd.DataFrame(data1) print(myvar) . teams standings 0 BARCA 1 1 REAL 2 2 ATLETICO 3 . Indexing and manipulaton of data through lists. . With pandas you can also organize the data which is one of its biggest perks, we call this indexing, this is when we define the first column in a data frame. | . import pandas as pd score = [5/5, 5/5, 1/5] myvar = pd.Series(score, index = [&quot;math&quot;, &quot;science&quot;, &quot;pe&quot;]) print(myvar) . math 1.0 science 1.0 pe 0.2 dtype: float64 . Pandas Classes . Within pandas the library consists of a lot of functions which allow you to manipulate datasets in lists dictionaries and csv files here are some of the ones we are going to cover (hint: take notes on these) . Series: A data frame that only has 1 column. | Index: Indexes are used to identify rows in a data frame. | PeriodIndex: Allows you to display data about something for every day, month, or year in a given time frame. | DataframeGroupedBy: Allows you to organize data and analyze data with functions such as mean(), min(), etc. | Categorical: Allows you to organize data into different categories. | Time Stamp: Allows you to display a specific time stamp. | . PeriodIndex . This allows for a way to repeat data over time that it occurs as seen from january 2022 to december 2023. You can use Y for years, M for months, and D for days. | . import pandas as pd time = pd.period_range(&#39;2022-01&#39;, &#39;2022-12&#39;, freq=&#39;M&#39;) print(time) . PeriodIndex([&#39;2022-01&#39;, &#39;2022-02&#39;, &#39;2022-03&#39;, &#39;2022-04&#39;, &#39;2022-05&#39;, &#39;2022-06&#39;, &#39;2022-07&#39;, &#39;2022-08&#39;, &#39;2022-09&#39;, &#39;2022-10&#39;, &#39;2022-11&#39;, &#39;2022-12&#39;], dtype=&#39;period[M]&#39;) . Now implement a way to show a period index from June 2022 to July 2023 in days. . time2 = pd.period_range(&#39;2022-06&#39;, &#39;2023-6&#39;, freq=&#39;D&#39;) # prints every day between provided dates print(time2) . PeriodIndex([&#39;2022-06-01&#39;, &#39;2022-06-02&#39;, &#39;2022-06-03&#39;, &#39;2022-06-04&#39;, &#39;2022-06-05&#39;, &#39;2022-06-06&#39;, &#39;2022-06-07&#39;, &#39;2022-06-08&#39;, &#39;2022-06-09&#39;, &#39;2022-06-10&#39;, ... &#39;2023-05-23&#39;, &#39;2023-05-24&#39;, &#39;2023-05-25&#39;, &#39;2023-05-26&#39;, &#39;2023-05-27&#39;, &#39;2023-05-28&#39;, &#39;2023-05-29&#39;, &#39;2023-05-30&#39;, &#39;2023-05-31&#39;, &#39;2023-06-01&#39;], dtype=&#39;period[D]&#39;, length=366) . Dataframe Grouped By . This allows for you to organize your data and calculate the different functions such as | count(): returns the number of non-null values in each group. | sum(): returns the sum of values in each group. | mean(): returns the mean of values in each group. | min(): returns the minimum value in each group. | max(): returns the maximum value in each group. | median(): returns the median of values in each group. | var(): returns the variance of values in each group. | agg(): applies one or more functions to each group and returns a new DataFrame with the results. | . import pandas as pd data = { &#39;Category&#39;: [&#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;, &#39;E&#39;, &#39;F&#39;], &#39;Value&#39;: [100, 250, 156, 255, 240, 303, 253, 3014] } df = pd.DataFrame(data) grouped = df.groupby(&#39;Category&#39;)#GUESS WHAT THIS WOULD BE IF WE WERE LOOKING FOR COMBINED TOTALS! -&gt; we can use the sum() function to find the combined totals print(grouped) . &lt;pandas.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0x7fa0e9909190&gt; .

What is GitHub?: GitHub is a software company which allows for users to create their own programming projects and collaborate with others if they so desire. | Why do we use GitHub? Why not Google Drive or messages? GitHub is better for creating programming projects and storing code. Google drive is not very useful for storing code as the code will not be formatted correctly and can&#39;t be run. | What&#39;s the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the version control system while GitHub is the service that stores code and makes it accessible to many people. | Name as many Git commands as you can: Git push, git merge, git pull, git fork, git clone | . Two Main Machines . Which is better, MacOS or Windows? Both MacOs and Windows are better in their own ways. Mac is better that Windows in that it is easier to navigate to different applications and sites (in my opinion). I don&#39;t use Windows, so I don&#39;t have any reasons why it would be better. I prefer MacOS over Windows. . | Give some differences between MacOS and Windows in terms of the development we use in APCSP: . | . I&#39;m not sure about how things are done with Windows as I use mac, but I know that things are installed differently on windows . If you are on Windows, you want to skip the MacOS Setup instructions. | . Our Tools: . What is the first tool you remember installing? Im not sure if this is the first tool I installed, but one of the first tools I installed was VSCode. . | Why were installations so hard the first time? Installations were hard during the first few weeks of CSP as I didn&#39;t know what I was doing and wasn&#39;t used to installing new things. . | Without looking back at previous notes, name three tools you remember installing. This can be kernels, extensions, any installation for APCSP, and also write why it is needed. . | . Python and JavaScript Kernels - Needed so I can code in python and javascript | VSCode - Allows me to write code in different files, work on many different repositories at a time, and create blog posts | Docker - Allows me to local host my projects to quickly see what my changes do | Actual Installations: . Tool setup is a week 0 thing. You should already have the knowledge to set up your machine. There is also a high chance you had to remove your environments and set up your machine again due to errors. If, for some reason, these don&#39;t apply to you, go here to set up your machine, here to check everything working with Bash, and here for Docker setup, which are the main tools on our machine needed to develop in APCSP. . MacOS Conda Scripts . After installing Homebrew, VSCode, and Python2, you&#39;ll need to run these Homebrew commands: . brew list # list packages brew update # update package list brew upgrade # upgrade packages brew install git # install latest git brew install python # install python3 for development python --version # version of python3 installed brew install java # openjdk install . Windows Conda Scripts . To get set up, run these commands: . wsl --install wsl --list wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04 # restart machine wsl cd ~ mkdir vscode ls cd ~/vscode # changes the directory to path for vscode files git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP.git # clone repo cd APCSP # changes the directory to path for APCSP repos assets code . # opens APCSP in VSCode cd .. # changes the directory to the previous/parent directory git config --global user.email mygmail@gmail.com # tell git your email git config --global user.name mygithub # tell git your github id shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.email your@email.here shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.name yourusernamehere # restart machine PS C: Users UserName&gt; wsl # Windows prompt to WSL command cd /tmp wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh chmod +x Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # Answer yes to all the prompts ./Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # run apt package commands now sudo apt list # list packages sudo apt update # update package list sudo apt upgrade # upgrade packages sudo apt install python2 # install python2 for package dependencies sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # install python3 and pip3 for development python --version # version of python3 should be shown sudo apt install default-jdk default-jre # java install java --version # java runtime version javac --version # java compiler version sudo apt install unzip # unzip utility . Setting Up Kernels . Now that you have everything installed on MacOS/Windows, we need to get kernels installed so that we can develop inside Fastpages notebooks. To do that, run these commands on both MacOS and Windows: . (base) id:~$ conda --version (base) id:~$ conda install jupyter # install jupyter (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list installed kernels Available kernels: python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ # start in home directory (base) id:~$ pip install bash_kernel # download bash kernel Collecting bash_kernel Downloading bash_kernel-0.7.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (15 kB) Requirement already satisfied: pexpect&gt;=4.0 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from bash_kernel) (4.8.0) Requirement already satisfied: ptyprocess&gt;=0.5 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from pexpect&gt;=4.0-&gt;bash_kernel) (0.7.0) Installing collected packages: bash-kernel Successfully installed bash-kernel-0.7.2 (base) id:~$ python -m bash_kernel.install # install kernel Installing IPython kernel spec (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ conda install nodejs # node is framework for JavaScript kernel (base) id:~$ npm -version # node package manager comes with nodejs (base) id:~$ npm install -g ijavascript # get the kernel (base) id:~$ ijsinstall # install javascript kernel (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash javascript /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/javascript python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 . By now, you should already know how to clone Git repositories into your VSCode directory. Once you do that, you&#39;re all set for developing with GitHub Pages and Fastpages! . Before We Set Up Pages, A Guide to Git . As we&#39;ve discussed, Git is different from GitHub. Because GitHub is merely the place where we store Git repos, we use Git&#39;s commands to help us get, open, and configure these repositories. Here are some of the Git commands you should be using a lot (In the comments, tell what each Git command does): . git clone {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? --&gt; allows you to make a copy of a repository that you can edit and modify git checkout [branch] # what does it do? --&gt; allows you to create a local branch git fork {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? --&gt; similar to git clone, but this copy is not affected by changed made to the original repository git commit -m {&quot;commit-msg&quot;} # what does it do? --&gt; allows you to save changes to the repository locally git pull # what does it do? --&gt; allows you to pull changes that have been made by others to the remote repository git push # what does it do? --&gt; allows you to sync your changes with the remote repository # After this line, name other commands that you can use and what they do. This should be easy, as you&#39;ve already answered the qeue git merge # --&gt; used to merge your local changes with what is the the remote repository git log # --&gt; allows you to view the history of changes of the repository . Setting Up GitHub Pages . Some of you may have come to know that GitHub Pages is starting to become outdated. So why do we still use it? The answer is that we are in a class, and following a curriculum with something like GitHub Pages is much easier than creating portfolio content from scratch, which becomes quite unecessary. Therefore, we can use GitHub Pages to create this content instead. On the topic of unecessary vs necessary coding, we don&#39;t need to make GitHub Pages from scratch as opposed to using a template that our very own Mr. Mortensen created for us. To do that, we can go to the Leuck Reunion repository and use the template to make our own GitHub Pages. Then, in Ubuntu, we can git clone our repository and open it in VSCode. After we have it open, the last thing we want to do is set up local hosting for this website, so that we can preview it and make changes in real time. To do that, head here to install Jekyll for Ubuntu, here to install Ruby next, and here to finalize the process by installing Bundler. . Setting Up FastPages . In Setting Up Github Pages, we talked about how it is easier to use a template to create portfolio content. It is also easier to use a template when creating the portfolio itself. To do that, we can use Fastpages, which is what we have been using to show our blogs, code, and projects. However, Fastpages has been deprecated for some time now, so the instructions in Week 0 won&#39;t be effective. So, we need to fork the APCSP Fastpages. To do that, follow this video to get started developing with Fastpages. . Hacks . Show how you incorporate three tools that we have installed into your project. 0.1 points for each feature. (0.3). This can include code, but definitely blog about it. | . VSCode: I used VSCode as my code browsing tool to develop the code for my projects and local host it to find and fix errors in my code. VSCode is also very helpful with debugging. . | Python and JavaScript Kernels: The API and database part of my code is created with the python kernel. The JavaScript kernel was used to code the frontend JavaScript part of my code with which the user interacts with. . | Docker: I used docker to local host my project and find errors that may have arisen. With local hosting, it&#39;s very easy to find these errors and find out how they can be fixed. It&#39;s also useful to keep track of my progress and how functional the code is. . | Video of Working Project . Project: Link . Frontend Code . This code will present the data stored in the database to the user. This will also take in the user&#39;s input, calculate the output, and present the output to the user which will then be stored in the database with the backend code. . &lt;style&gt; h1 { color: blue; margin-bottom: 60px; font-family; georgia; text-align: center; } iframe { width: 90%; height: fixed; filter: invert(75%); } .content{ display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-direction: column; } .content&gt;*{ padding: 10px; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div id=&#39;content&#39;&gt; &lt;form id=&#39;nameForm&#39;&gt; &lt;div class=&#39;form-uname&#39;&gt; &lt;label id=&#39;nameLable&#39; for=&#39;nameField&#39;&gt;Input the City:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=&#39;nameField&#39; type=&#39;text&#39; maxlength=&#39;25&#39;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&#39;form-sub&#39;&gt; &lt;button id=&#39;subButton&#39; type=&#39;button&#39;&gt;Submit!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;p id=&#39;result&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; latitude = 0; longitude = 0; // add code to get city name from user function getUserName() { var nameField = document.getElementById(&#39;nameField&#39;).value; var result = document.getElementById(&#39;result&#39;); const options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, headers: { &#39;X-Access-Token&#39;: &#39;c203885d962780e0f71c0a1e65db31e3&#39;, &#39;X-RapidAPI-Key&#39;: &#39;f56b20ef1cmsh82a127be1b400c6p1e21bcjsn093efcf02b8f&#39;, &#39;X-RapidAPI-Host&#39;: &#39;travelpayouts-travelpayouts-flight-data-v1.p.rapidapi.com&#39; } }; fetch(&#39;https://travelpayouts-travelpayouts-flight-data-v1.p.rapidapi.com/data/en-GB/cities.json&#39;, options) .then(response =&gt; response.json()) .then(response =&gt; { console.log(response) var dictionary = 0 for (let i = 0; i &lt; response.length; i++){ if (response[i][&#39;name&#39;] == nameField){ dictionary = response[i] console.log(dictionary) } } if (dictionary == 0){ const textDiv = document.getElementById(&#39;text&#39;); const p = document.createElement(&#39;P&#39;); const pText = document.createTextNode(&quot;City not found.&quot;); textDiv.appendChild(p); p.appendChild(pText); } // add code to search for the user input city in the API response and fetch latitude and longitude for it latitude = dictionary.coordinates.lat longitude = dictionary.coordinates.lon url = &#39;https://aerodatabox.p.rapidapi.com/airports/search/location/&#39; + latitude + &#39;/&#39; + longitude + &#39;/km/50/16?withFlightInfoOnly=false&#39; const textDiv = document.getElementById(&#39;text&#39;); const p = document.createElement(&#39;P&#39;); const pText = document.createTextNode(&#39;&#39;); textDiv.appendChild(p); p.appendChild(pText); const aerodataboxOptions = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, headers: { &#39;X-RapidAPI-Key&#39;: &#39;f56b20ef1cmsh82a127be1b400c6p1e21bcjsn093efcf02b8f&#39;, &#39;X-RapidAPI-Host&#39;: &#39;aerodatabox.p.rapidapi.com&#39; } }; fetch(url, aerodataboxOptions) .then(response =&gt; response.json()) .then(response =&gt; { console.log(response) var airport = response.items[0].name var num = 0 for (let i = 0; i &lt; airport.length; i++){ if (airport[i] == &quot;,&quot;){ num += 2 break } num += 1 } airport = airport.slice(num) // add code to extract airport name and print on the webpage const textDiv = document.getElementById(&#39;text&#39;); // const p = document.createElement(&#39;P&#39;); const pText = document.createTextNode(&quot;Nearest Airport to &quot; + nameField + &quot;: &quot; + airport); // textDiv.appendChild(p); p.appendChild(pText); }) .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err)); }) .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err)); } var subButton = document.getElementById(&#39;subButton&#39;); subButton.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, getUserName, false); &lt;/script&gt; .

            "title": "2018 Practice Test Corrections",
            "content": "Introduction: . In this practice exam, I got a score of 63/66 questions correct. This blog will contain the mistakes I made while taking this test, the correct answers to the questions I got wrong, what I learned from reviewing the correct answers, and a reflection which highlights what I learned from this test. The following image shows the amount of time it took for me to complete this test. . . In the actual AP exam, we are given 120 minutes to answer 70 MC questions. This means we are given about 1 minute and 43 seconds per problem. Since I took about 2 minutes and 35 seconds per problem (52 more seconds than maximum time per question), I need to work on improving my speed. . Topics I Wasn’t Sure About/Needed to Review: . Throughout this test, there were a few topics I didn’t. To clarify my uncertainties, I watched a few AP Daily videos and searched a few terms up to help me understand these topics. The following list contains some of the topics I learned about through these AP Daily videos and Google: . AP Daily: . Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Encryption | Copyright | Citizen Science | . Google: . Machine Learning Program | Cloud Computing (still got this question wrong) | . Question 9: . . For this question, I think the reason I got this wrong is because I didn’t understand what the question was asking. After looking at College Board’s answer (“It helps programmers identify errors as components are added to a working program.”), I realized that the question was asking for why incrementally adding new lines is beneficial. With this, it makes sense that the answer is D (the answer I previously quoted) because after adding every new line, errors about the previous lines of code can be found and solved. The answer I selected was answer C (“It enables programmers to create programs that use the lowest-level abstractions available.”) because I didn’t understand what the question was asking. I saw the word “iterative” and I thought the program would be made simpler with the use of iteration (looking back, this reasoning doesn’t make much sense). . Question 14: . . The reason I got this question wrong was because I thought about this problem intuitively incorrectly. I realize now that since both displaying the variable i and increasing its value happens in the same iteration, the number of values displayed will be the same. This is why the answer I selected is incorrect. However, since the order of operations is different, the values displayed will be off by 1 between the 2 two programs (the values in Program B being 1 higher than the values in Program A). This is why the answer is C (“Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ.”) because the the number of values displayed is the same for both programs, but the values displayed are slightly different (shifted by 1). . Question 64: . . This question was about cloud computing which I am still not very familiar with. The questions asked for which of the statements provided shows how cloud computing has affected Internet communication. The correct answer given by College Board are answers B and C while the answers I selected are A and B. College Board states that the B is correct because cloud computing allows for many people to collaborate and share ideas to different files for something like a project. With many different people making edits to a project, collaboration is enhanced. College Board states that answer C is correct because considering security concerns and protecting users’ private data is important. I’m still not sure how this shows how cloud computing affects Internet communication and how we were supposed to know this, but I do know that protecting user’s privacy is important. . Reflection: . What I Did Well: . Something I did well was that my answers to the questions were mostly correct as I got an A on this test. I understood most of the concepts I was tested on and didn’t find any problems particularly challenging. Even though I had to think through a few of them to understand what they were asking of me and what the correct answer was, I found this test to be pretty doable. . What I Need to Work On: . Since my score on this test was pretty good, the thing I need to work on is getting faster. Like I mentioned before, on average I took about 52 seconds more per question than expected of me by College Board. Even though I was accurate, I spent way too much time on each question. . Overall . Overall, there were things that I did well and things that I need to improve on. Since this is just a practice exam, I have time to improve on the topics I might have found difficult and my other areas of struggle. .",

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP).

Answer: Yes, this network is fault tolerant because there are at least 2 connections on each computer which means that if any connection is removed, every computer would be able to connect with any other computer. . . Answer: No, this network is not fault tolerant as computer F doesn’t have at least 2 connections. This means that removing the one connection to computer F will make it so none of the computers can communicate with computer F. . . Answer: No, this network is not fault tolerant because computer A only have 1 connections and removing this connections will make it so that none of the other computers can communicate with it. . Video 2 . . Answer: The answer is answer C because even though it’s true that only one route will be taken at a time, this is not an example of a benefit of a fault tolerant network like the other examples. Also, this can be true with networks that are not fault tolerant too. . . Answer: A connection from A to B would make this network fault tolerant because then each computer will have at least 2 connections.

            "content": "Introduction: . . This test, I was able to get 48/50 questions correct. At first, I had no idea how to do a lot of the problems. After asking Mr. Yeung about these problems, he told me that the topics I wasn’t sure on came from Big Idea 4. To learn more about the topics I didn’t understand, I watched all the Big Idea 4 AP Daily videos. After watching these videos, I knew how to do the problems I didn’t understand previously. I think the score I got is a good score and I think I did well on this MCQ. The rest of this blog will be purposed to correcting the few mistakes that I made and reflecting upon these mistakes and what I learned from this test. . Question 10: . . For this question, I selected answer B (“The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer’s protocol to the other computer’s protocol.”) because I didn’t realize that all devices on the Internet communicate using standard protocols. I thought that the protocols are slightly different and more hardware is needed to transfer or communicate data from one computer to another. College Board’s answer is answer D (“The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.”) because of how devices on the Internet communicate using standard protocols which don’t depend on the manufacturer. . Question 41: . . This questions asks which procedure would be most useful in fulfilling the purpose of the student’s program. I selected option A (“A procedure containsNegatives, which returns true if any negative values appear in the column and returns false otherwise.”) because I didn’t think any of the other procedures were useful and the procedure containsNegatives would at least provide if there is a negative number in the column at all. The answer College Board says is correct is answer C (“A procedure findNegative, which returns the row number of the first negative value that appears in the column or -1 if there are no negative values.”) because it can be repeatedly called to change the first negative of the column to 0 until there are no more negative values in the column left. After reading this explanation, I can’t believe I chose the other answer. This answer makes so much sense! . Reflection: . Overall, after watching the College Board videos for Big Idea 4, I found this quiz to be okay and I understood and correctly answered most of the questions. Even though there were a few questions I got wrong, after reviewing the correct answer and College Board’s explanation of why their answer is correct, I was able to understand the mistakes I made leading to me getting them wrong. .",

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is constant or O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # The output doesn&#39;t contain duplicates (in this case it doesn&#39;t the duplicate 1 and 2) # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # They are in the same tech talk because hashmaps are commonly used to implement sets. . {1, 2, 3} .

            "content": "Introduction . The guest speakers (John and Ashley) mainly talked about the college Cal State San Marcos and all the opportunities available in this college. They made it appeal to students in CSP by talking about all the STEM related activities that we can partake in. The purpose of this presentation I feel was also to inform CSP students about what needs to be done in preparation for college, during college, and after college. . Notes on Presentation . Speaker’s Background . John: A computer scientist who graduated from Cal State San Marcos | He is from Escondido | Started at Palomar College for 2 years and later transferred to Cal State San Marcos | Obtained a computer science degree | Took about 6 years to get bachelor’s degree | He believes computer science is a very versatile field to get into | . | Ashley: Also graduated from Cal State San Marcos | Works in a quantum computing group | Loves physics and pursued it in college (got physics degree) Even though she failed AP Physics in high school, she still decided to pursue it (she believes that even if you aren’t very good at something, you can still pursue it if it’s interesting and fun to you) | . | She will later try to earn a PhD for material science and engineering | . | . Cal State San Marcos (CSUSM) . Pathways at CSUSM: Computer science, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, robotics, and STEM There are many CS pathways available | . | It’s very important to sign up for and join clubs during undergraduate years Clubs can be fun, teach you about new interesting topics, and fill up your time with something productive and useful | . | . Fun Facts about Cal State San Marcos: . . Internships . A period of work experience offered by an organization for a limited period of time | Ways to find internship opportunities: Join clubs, check your emails, go to campus events, google internship opportunities at other universities | Avoid unpaid internships (many fun and interesting internship opportunities where a lot of money can be made) You should be paid for the work you put in during your internships | Many internships offer thousands of dollars for a few months of work | . | Internships are very valuable as they offer money that can be used for enrolling in a college, they offer experiences that you can’t get elsewhere, and you can learn about things that you are interested in and things that will be helpful later on in your career | . Paying for College . There are three main ways students acquire the money to go to college: Loans, Grants, and Scholarships. | The main different between a loan and a grant or scholarship is that loans needs to be payed back because money is being borrowed . | Loans: It’s generally best to avoid taking loans as they need to be paid back with interest | Types of Loans: A subsidized loan: This is a loan partially funded by the government. These loans are usually loans for undergraduate students with financial need. Subsidized loans don’t accumulate interest while you are in school at least half-time or during deferment periods | An unsubsidized loan: An unsubsidized loan are both undergraduate and graduate students. Unlike subsidized loans, they are not based on financial need. Also, the government doesn’t pay interest for this type of loan. | . | Since they are partially funded by the government, if you had to take a loan because you are not financially able to go to college, it’s best to take a subsidized loan | If you need to borrow a lot of money, you might need to take an unsubsidized loan as these loans have a higher limit meaning you can borrow more money than with a subsidized loan | . | Grants: Similarly to loans, grants are given based on financial need (not loans as they don’t need to be paid back) | Even though it’s easier to get a grant than a scholarship, grants are still vey competitive and don’t offer as much money as scholarships | There aren’t as many grants available as scholarships | It’s possible to receive more than 1 grant based on financial need | . | Scholarship: Scholarships, unlike grants, are given based on students’ academic achievements rather than financial need (also don’t need to be paid back) | It’s difficult to obtain a scholarship as even qualified students sometimes don’t receive them | Just like with grants, there is high competition for scholarships | Scholarships look good on a resume when applying for jobs as they convey your outstanding academic achievements | . | . How to Find Scholarship/Grant Opportunities: . Apply for FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) | Check student email | Google “undergraduate scholarship applications” | Schedule an appointment for the financial aid office | . Life after CSUSM (What people did after graduating from CSUSM): . Many continued with graduate school | People obtained a career in biomedical, environmental, chemical, and electronic fields | Many became a teacher | Many found a career in a variety of government agencies | . Toothbrush Activity . Intro . After the speakers had finished their presentation about Cal State San Marcos, they told us they planned an activity for us in which we would be able to construct something. They went around handing out the materials: A toothbrush head, a set of small batteries, a few wires, and some electrical tape. With these materials given to us, we had to construct a mechanism that vibrated and could move around. . Creating the Gadget . To create this gadget, I first took out a pair of batteries from their container and set them on the table. I then took a pair of wires and attached them between the batteries. When the wires were pressed hard against the batteries, the whole thing would vibrate. This contraption was then attached to a head of a tooth brush and held together by tape (the tape applied pressure to ensure the gadget would vibrate). . Here is an image of Colin and I collaborating on this project: . . Vibrating Toothbrush Video . . How it Works . This gadget works by conducting electricity between the 2 batteries through the wires connecting them. This transmission of electricity between the 2 batteries is what causes the system to vibrate and move across the table in the way that it does. . Reflection . Overall, I found the presentation given by the guest speakers and the activity they planned after the presentation to be very enjoyable. I learned a lot about the Cal State San Marcos and what types of programs they offer. I also learned about things I didn’t know much about previously like internships and different ways people can come up with the money to pay for college. I think the speakers did a good job sharing their experiences with Cal State San Marcos and I found what they had to say about it interesting. .",

I was able to get a good score on this quiz after watching the big idea 2 videos and doing well on the practice quizzes of big idea 2. With this practice and the knowledge I obtained from these videos and quizzes, I was able to do good on this quiz. . Questions I Found Challenging: . I didn’t find any questions particularly challenging as they were all about topics I had either learned about in big idea 2 or topics I already knew about from before. Also, there weren’t many questions where silly mistakes could be made as compared to other quizzes and tests where making a small error could result in the entire question being answered wrong. I would have talked about and explained a few questions that I found challenging in the quiz, but I didn’t find any questions very challenging or noteworthy to talk about. . Reflection: . Overall, I found this quiz to be pretty doable and there weren’t any questions that confused me or gave me a hard time. And as a result, I correctly answer the questions. Additionally, another factor that contributed to me doing good on this quiz was that some of the questions were reused from the other big idea 2 practice quizzes. Since I remembered what I put as answers for these questions, I wouldn’t be able to get these questions wrong. And of the remaining questions that weren’t from other practice quizzes, they weren’t too difficult and I was able to figure the answers to them. .",

            "title": "Data Structures- Space and Time Complexity",
            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . A programmer should care about space and time complexity because taking up less space will allow the excess space to be used for other tasks. Since this algorithms will achieve the same goal, the algorithms working differently and producing different outputs will note be a problem. Also, the algorithm might take way too much time than available or too long for its purpose. Reducing the amount of time without changing the output would be useful. | .

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . I think this is both a time complexity and space complexity problem. This is a time complexity problem because since there are more pixels being generated when the image is larger, the value of n will be larger (in big o notation), making the amount of time needed to generate the output larger than if the image is smaller. Since the image has a greater number of pixels, more bits are needed to store the image making the space complexity larger as well. These are both problems because taking up too much space takes space away from other things that it could be used for and taking up too much time is bad in most situations. | . Big O Notation .

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . # for i in numbers: # for j in numbers: # print(i,j) Can&#39;t run this because I tried it committing the file after running it and the page crashed. . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) # print(fibonacci(30)) print(fibonacci(40)) . 102334155 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) .

Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 5702887 Time taken: 1.6604831218719482 seconds 9227465 Time taken: 2.617706060409546 seconds . Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | . Different algorithms of different time complexities took different amounts of time to run. The algorithms with larger time complexities (with similar input size values (n)) took longer to run while the algorithms with smaller time complexities took less time to run. For me, the difference in time elapsed ranged from 0.0 sec (many algorithms) to 3 min and 3.5 sec (quadratic time algorithm). . Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | . The following table highlights a few examples of sorting algorithms and their time complexities. . Name of Sorting Algorithm Time Complexity Big O Notation (Worst-Case) . Selection Sort | Exponential | O(n^2) | . Bubble Sort | Exponential | O(n^2) | . Heap Sort | Logarithmic | O(nlog n) | . Merge Sort | Logarithmic | O(nlog n) | . Quick Sort | Exponential | O(n^2) | . Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | . Time complexity is important when choosing and algorithm because in most cases, the output should be outputted in the least amount of time possible. For example, if the user want to use a calculator program during a test, there are time constraints for the test so the output needs to be displayed as soon as possible. Space complexity is also important because of something takes up less space than the same output for another algorithm which has larger time complexity, that extra space could be saved to store something else. For example if 2 songs can be stored in a certain number of bits in one algorithm and 5 songs can be stored in the same amount of space in another algorithm, it would be more practical to use the latter as more songs would be stored in the same amount of space. . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | . Even though it would be amazing if constant time could always be used as it generally takes less time than any other type of algorithm (assuming that the value of n is the same), this is not possible because the majority of algorithms can&#39;t be created with constant time. Many require larger time complexities like logarithmic and exponential. Some sorting algorithms that require logarithmic and exponential time complexities are selection sort, heap sort, merge sort, bubble sort, and quick sort (the sorting algorithms listed in the table above). Since these algorithms can&#39;t be created with smaller time complexities, these larger time complexities need to be used. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . Since n is a factor when determining how long it will take for an algorithm to execute, I saw that when you increase the size of an image or increase the size of a list, the time it takes for the program to be executed will be longer even when nothing else is changed. This is usually because having a longer list means more items need to be iterated through making it take longer. Or in the example of the image, more pixels need to be generated making the program take longer to be executed. I also noticed that the program that took the longest to execute was the one in exponential time which makes sense because this is the largest time complexity. Also the larger images or larger lists have larger space complexity because more bits are needed to store the larger amount of data. . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Question 1 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is choice 3. Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(N+M) because the first for loops iterates N time while the second for loop iterates M times. All of these iterations need to be accounted for making the time complexity O(N+M). Space Complexity: Since there are only 2 variables (a and b), the space complexity is constant (O(1)). . Question 2 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is choice 4 because there are nested for loops. . Question 3 . Answer and Explanation: Even though this might seem like another algorithm in exponential time, the answer is actually choice 2 (O(nLogn)) because the variable j in the nested for loop doubles every iteration. . Question 4 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is choice 2 because when one algorithm is asymptotically more efficient than another algorithm, it takes less time and is therefore better than the other algorithm. . Question 5 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is choice 4 (time complexity of O(logN)) because of how i is halved each iteration. . Question 6 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is choice 3 (both time and memory are useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms) because they can be seen as time complexity (time) and space complexity (memory). Time complexity can show the efficiency of an algorithm because the algorithm that takes the least amount of time while producing the same output is the most efficient. Space complexity can show the efficiency of an algorithm because the algorithm with an output that takes up the least number of bits while producing the same output is the most efficient. . Question 7 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is choice 2 (&quot;By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size.&quot;). This explains how time complexity is measured because the more steps that are performed, the greater amount of time it will take for the algorithm to be executed. Additionally the given input size can be seen as n in big o notation. . Question 8 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is choice 3 (O(logkn)) because i is multiplied by k every iteration and the number of iterations required for i to be greater than n can be found by solving the equation k^x = n, where x is the number of iterations. . Question 9 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is choice 3 because there are n(n-1)/2 total iterations in the inner nested loop making the time complexity n(n-1). . Question 10 . Answer and Explanation: The answer is false because the time it takes for the algorithm to run also depends on the value of n. If the value of n is higher in algorithm B, it could take longer for algorithm B to run than algorithm A. .",

Explore SQLite Connect object to establish database connection- Explore SQLite Cursor Object to fetch data from a table within a database | . Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema?: A database schema is the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database?: The columns in a database contain the attributes of the class that all the entries in the database have. | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?: A primary key is something that can be used to identify and object or entry in the database. In our case, the uid is unique and can therefore be used to identify a specific user in the database. | What are the Data Types in SQL table?: Some of the possible data types in an SQL table include strings, integers, floats, and images. | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? A connection object allows the programmer to connect with the database and interact with it. This way the programmer can search for things, display things, and do so much more with the database. | Same for cursor object?:After connecting to the sqlite database, the cursor object allows us to search through the database and fetch for different parts of it.- Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object?: After using the VSCode debugger, I found that the attributes in the conn object are special variables, function variables, and class variables. Some of the attributes of the cursor object are special variables, function variables, connection, and description. | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know?: Yes, results is an object listed under the cursor object. It&#39;s an object because it contains data and attributes (like the conn and cursor objects) of each user. | . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() .

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? In both versions, the create function would gather inputs for each attribute of the object from the user and add it to the database a new entry. However, the method in which the program does this is different in the 2 lessons. In the 2.4a lesson, the program used user.create() to create a user, while the 2.4b lesson used cursor.execute and conn.commit() to create a user. The code in 2.4b looks simpler and more compact than the code in 2.4a. | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init?:SQL INSERT takes the values inputted by the user for name, uid, password, and dob and inserts them into a list which represents an entry in the database. It is used to insert these attributes into the database as a new entry. | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() create() . A new user record sachitprasad123 has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do?:If the password inputted by the user is shorter than 2 characters, the password is changed to &quot;gothackednewpassword123&quot; as it&#39;s a longer and therefore more secure password. The message hacked will also displayed showing that the user selected by the user wasn&#39;t secure, so they got hacked.- Explain try/except, when would except occur?: Try except blocks are generally used to check for errors. If the try block doesn&#39;t work as intended, the except block runs which usually states that an error occurred with the process being run in the try block. | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated?: In all of these examples, the connect and cursor objects are used to allow us to connect and interact with the database. Without these, we wouldn&#39;t be able to access and use use the CRUD operations on the database to edit it. This is why this process is repeated whenever a change (create, update, delete) is needed to be made to the database. | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() update() . No uid was not found in the table . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why?:Delete is a dangerous operation because once an entry is deleted, it can&#39;t be brought back and is lost. This is why it&#39;s important to make sure you are deleting the correct entry whenever you use this CRUD operation.- In the print statements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do?: The &quot;f&quot; is used so we can include variables that aren&#39;t strings like &quot;{uid}&quot; so we can print them along side strings. The {uid} displays the uid for an entry in the table. Curly brackets are used to show the value of uid rather than the word itself. | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() delete() . No uid was not found in the table . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat?:The menu repeats to allow the user to select a CRUD operation as many times as they wish until they feel they are satisfied.- Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List?: This menu could be changed to work with a list by storing the different crud operations in a list rather than as in if and elif statements. | . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. | In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction?: | . Yes, lots of procedural abstraction can be seen in this implementation. The CRUD functions (create, read, update, and delete) divide the program into parts and categorize it by what each part does. Additionally, the menu function basically combines all the functions into one function allowing you to do any CRUD function just by running one code segment. These elements also make it easier to read the program as all the code is in a specific function which is labeled with its purpose rather than a huge block of code where nothing is organized. . In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture . Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. . Yes, data abstraction is present in both 2.4a and 2.4b as the code is condensed and its internal functions are hidden from the user. When the user wants to create, read, update, or delete from the database, the user simply needs to input a few things at most to get the desired result. In this way, the internal functions are hidden as the user doesn&#39;t know what is happening behind the scenes in the program. Also, the code is condensed as everything has a purpose and all the code is grouped well and put where it should be located. . | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project. . | . | .

Supercooling is when water stays in its liquid phase and doesn’t turn into a solid (ice) even when the water’s temperature is below its freezing point. If you were to hit the water bottle on a something like a table, however, the water starts to turn into ice. . How does Supercooling Work? . Even though the water is below its freezing point (0°C), it doesn’t turn into ice because it needs to have a place where the ice crystal can start forming (there needs to be a nucleation event which is the initial process that occurs in the formation of a crystal). Also, for this phenomenon to occur, the water needs to be pure because impurities act as sites where the crystal can start forming. In pure water without these impurities, ice will not form until you disturb the water. This can be done by hitting a water bottle on a surface causing a few water molecules to line up in the right way and form ice. As more and more water molecules are oriented correctly more and more ice will be formed until all of the water in the water bottle has turned into ice. .",

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

AP Prep . AP Prep . Score . Question 1 - Correct . Question 2 - Correct . Question 3 - Correct . Question 4 - Incorrect . Explanation: For this question, the reason I selected answer D (&quot;Total dollar amount of food and drinks sold during the show&quot;) was because I knew that the number of food and drinks sold would correlate to attendance or number of people who showed up to the concert. However, College Board&#39;s answer was A (&quot;Average ticket price&quot;) because the attendance can be calculated by dividing the total dollar amount of all tickets sold by the average ticket price. I didn&#39;t realize that the attendance could be calculated this way so I got this question wrong. . Question 5 - Correct . Question 6 - Correct .

            "content": "Introduction: . This test, I was able to get 48/50 questions correct. I think this is a good score and I am proud of myself for getting it. Throughout the remainder of this blog I will correct my mistakes and reflect upon what I learned from this test. . Question 2: . . For this question, I didn’t really understand what cookies are and what their importance is. I also understood that if someone gets a hold of your IP address, this can cause a lot of trouble. Because of this prior knowledge I had about IP addresses, I thought that someone getting hold of the IP address of the user’s computer would have the greatest potential to compromise the user’s privacy. The answer states that A (“A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser”) is the correct answer because the information stored in browser cookies can be used by the websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about them. It also states that the answer I selected (“The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer”) is incorrect because the IP address itself doesn’t contain a lot of private information about the user and it’s needed for the user to send and receive information on the Internet. . Question 49: . . I’m still not sure why the answer I selected is considered incorrect, but I understand why the correct answer is correct. The reasoning given by College Board states that the answer is B (“The model used by the simulation software often omits details so that it is easier to implement.”) because it’s impossible to get every detail for a situation and implement them into a simulation. Instead, simulations are designed to incorporate the most important details to make them as accurate as possible. The reason why I selected D (“Running a simulation requires a large number of observations to be collected before it can be used to explore a problem.”) is because I thought that simulations had to use data from other similar events to predict what would happen. Even though I still believe this could be a possible answer, I completely understand why the answer given in the answer key is correct. . Reflection: . Overall, I found this quiz to be pretty straightforward and I understood and correctly answered most of the questions. Even though there were a few questions I got wrong, I was able to understand why I got them wrong and why the answer listed in the answer key is correct after review. Just like with the previous MCQ tests, I found it fun to solve these problems because they are kind of like puzzles. .",

AP Prep . Score . Question 1 - Correct . Question 2 - Correct . Question 3 - Correct . Lossy Data Compression Image . Explanation: With these examples with decreasing a song file&#39;s size or decreasing a video&#39;s size, the actual content is changed to decrease the number of bits needed to store the data. In the song file&#39;s case, something that might be removed are the frequencies in the song that human&#39;s are unable to hear. This way, even though the song itself is changed, the change would be undetectable. For the video file, the same method concerning frequencies could also be used as a good method of lossy compression. Also, different scenes containing similar pixel colors can be changed to have the same pixel colors making the visual aspects of the video more simple and therefore compressed. . Lossless Data Compression Image . Explanation: With the example of this text, lossless data is good way to reduce the number of bits needed to store the data. A legend can be used to store repeated words as a symbol. This way, less words are needed to store the data and therefore less bits are needed to store the data. Also, the actual content is not changed, but is only simplified making this an example of lossless data. .

The create_entry function takes in 2 parameters (the city and airport) and sends a POST request to send the city with its airport to the database. I’ve also added an error checking aspect to it which checks to see if POST request was successful. If a response of 200 is not returned, an error is printed in the console.

            "content": "Night at the Museum Info . Just like in trimester 1, the idea of the Night at the museum is the same. Night at the museum is a day where people can art pieces from different art classes are presented for people to see and admire. These pieces set on display are the culmination of lots of hard work and dedication put in by many students. This day is purposed to showing off the accomplishments of these students. . My experience at Night at the Museum . Computer Animation . The first class I explored was computer animation. Most of the projects displayed where scenes created by students related to donuts. There were many cool scenes created that I found interesting. Here are some examples: . . . . Studio Art . Another class I went to was studio art. There were many different paintings and art pieces hung around the room. Some of these painting looked like they were created by professional artists. I couldn’t believe that students could make such beautiful works of art. Here is one of my favorite paintings that I found truly fascinating: . . Ceramics . Next, I went to the ceramics classroom to see what students in that class created. Here, there were many sculptures about different things ranging from animals to common objects. Here is one of my favorites shown below: . . Photography . I also had a chance to take a look at pictures taken for the photography class. These pictures captured scenes like landscapes, close-ups of various objects, and selfies. The picture I found most alluring was a picture of a duck swimming in golden water (the water is gold because of the light from the sun): . . Jazz . The class I visited that was unlike the others was jazz as it focuses on auditory art rather than visual art. Since I am in band, I have a little experience in music and I truly enjoyed listening to the jazz music. I could tell that the student musicians were talented and worked hard to become so good. Since I visited this class with my friend Edwin, I took a picture of him in front of the jazz performers: . . CSP and CSA . Lastly, I also was able to see what other groups in CSP and CSA were working on. I was surprised by how good these projects were and how hard these students must have worked on them. Their projects functioned as intended and looked appealing and well made. Here are some of the projects I had a chance to view: . . . . Reflection . Overall, I not only had a fun time presenting what I had worked on with my project, but I also had fun seeing other computer science projects and art from an assortment of other classes. Some of my favorite classes that I visited were photography, jazz, and studio art. I had a good time and I hope I could have an experience like this again in the future. .",

Drones Benefits: Drones can be used as a hobby or form of entertainment | They can be useful in search and rescue | they can also be used to take pictures and videos | . | Harmful Effects: They can be used to spy on people | They can be used to commit crimes | There is also a possibility that they can be hijacked and be used for evil purposes | . | . | ChatGPT Benefits: We can learn a lot about different topics from ChatGPT that we might not be able to get from Google ChatGPT finds information that is more specific to your request than Google | . | ChatGPT can be a useful tool if you don’t understand what something is and want a general understanding of what it is | . | Harmful Effects: The easy access to information gained from ChatGPT can lead to misuse Students can use ChatGPT to cheat on assignments and get answers to questions that they should be coming up with themselves | We can claim work created by ChatGPT as our own | . | It’s possible for the AI to find inaccurate information from a source that is not credible | . | . | Dopamine Positives: Occasional dopamine can be good as it makes us feel good and happy | . | Negatives: Excessive dopamine can result in addictions Addictions can take over and ruin your life | Example of Addiction and Excessive Dopamine: Anthony Rosner, who was 17 years old, had an addiction of playing World of Warcraft | This addiction let to him neglecting his schoolwork, relationships, health, and even his hygiene | . | . | Constantly releasing dopamine can also reduce the pleasure gained from an activity | . | . | . Big Idea 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects Reflection . 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . Simulations: Beneficial: Simulations are beneficial because they allow us to use previously collected data to simulate possible outcomes for something. | Harmful Effects: In some cases, simulations might not account for every detail which might create a crucial miscalculation in the results (very rare). | . | Smartphones: Beneficial: Smartphones are beneficial because they are portable and they provide us with easy access to a lot of information. | Harmful Effects: One harmful effect of smartphones is that they can be addicting. With the numerous apps created solely for the purpose of entertainment, it’s very easy for one to get addicted to their phone. Especially with the rise of social media, more and more people are glued to their phones. | . | Social Media: Beneficial: With social media, people can meet and make friends online and stay connected with their friends. | Harmful Effects: Like I mentioned before, social media is very addictive. Many people have an uncontrollable urge to constantly check their phone for notifications from social media platforms. Social media can also take away from real in person relationships when people are always on their phones. | . | . 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Dopamine issues are absolutely real and are a big problem. Problems with dopamine are affecting countless people around the world. For example, Anthony Rosner, who was 17 years old, had an addiction of playing World of Warcraft. He spent up to 18 hours a day, every day playing this game. This went on for nearly 2 years. This addiction led him to neglect his schoolwork, relationships, health, and even his hygiene. We can see that in this person’s case, this dopamine issue resulted in a negative impact on Rosner’s studies and success in high school. . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide Class Discussion Notes . Some religious groups choose not to use technology | Poorer or rural areas may not have much access to technology | Even in San Diego county alone, there are distinctions in many categories between the Northern and Southern population | During distance learning, many schools did not have access to technology making it hard to teach with social distancing | Some countries may have different or restricted access For example, China often restricts access to certain services | . | Disadvantages of not having access to technology: People without much access to technology would not be able to keep track of the current events happening around them | These people would also not have access to the abundant information available on the internet | Without technology, these people also wouldn’t be able to communicate with other people over long distances | . | . Big Idea 5.2 Digital Divide Reflection . 1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . One can empower themselves in a digital world by learning as much as they can from technology and implementing what they learned in their lives. For example, if you are interested in being a programmer and want to pursue that as a career, you can make use of the internet and learn about what coding is about and how to do it. In our digital world has given rise to many opportunities and it’s important that you take some of these opportunities and learn more about different topics. . 2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by showing how useful and great the internet is. If someone does not believe in long term gratification and the benefits of learning more to be more successful and happy in the future, then it’s important that you explain these benefits. In Del Norte, we have the option to take any class and join any club or other extracurricular activities we want. We can take advantage of this and encourage people to challenge themselves with classes they take and try different extracurricular activities. . 3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . In my opinion paper does not limit digital empowerment. In fact, paper can be a great tool for digital empowerment because it’s more efficient to make diagrams and visual projects on paper because of how fast and easy it is. A barrier present at Del Norte that blocks digital empowerment is can be how many sites are restricted. Even though this is not a very big problem and actually provides more good than harm, it can be frustrating when you are trying to learn more about something and the website you go to is blocked by the school. Overall, it is evident that there aren’t many barriers to digital empowerment because digital use is growing with each coming day. . 5.1 and 5.2 Canvas Questions . 1. Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit . Our project offers the user with a list of buildings with their pictures and descriptions about them, so people can decide where they want to travel to based on which building they want to visit. | Our project will make it easy for the user to plan their vacation to visit a famous building as we have many features that will accommodate for the user’s every need. | Different users who speak and understand different languages will be able to use our site with our translator. | 2. Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. . There aren’t really any harmful effects of our project, but a drawback is that the user can’t actually purchase the tickets for their flight on our site. Our website’s purpose is only to help the user plan for their flight. . 3. Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . Internet blockers at school are useful because they restrict students from going to sites that they shouldn’t be or aren’t related to school. Internet blockers can also protect students from malicious sites that want to steal information. These internet blocker can also be disadvantageous as there might be some sites that aren’t bad and might be useful to students that are blocked. The lack of admin password on lab machines at school can be advantageous as it’s easier for admins to get access the computers without having to type in a password. This easy access to admin permissions without needing to know a password makes it easier for unauthorized people to tamper with these admin permissions in ways that could harm the school. . 4. What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . I wouldn’t face many problems with the digital divide because I don’t have many problems with my access to technology. I have all the technological resources I need to learn more about different topics and have access to all the other benefits of having technology. For others, however, who might not have as much access to technology, it will be hard for them to do much in a world that is mainly focused on technology. In this day and age, it’s crucial to have access to technology. . Big Ideas 5.3 and 5.4: . Big Idea 5.3 Computing Bias . Intentional or Purposeful bias (Crossover Group Up, 10 minutes) . TikTok is usually used by and marketed towards younger ages It attracts younger ages through the way the short videos capture the attention of these kids | Also, the music and bright colors also help to captivate these audiences | . | Facebook is often used by older users as it is used more for communication rather than entertainment | People use facebook to share their life with others and learn about what others are doing and it’s not as addicting as Tiktok TikTok is made to be addicting to young users with the way it recommends videos in a particular way that makes users want to watch more and more | . | Even though this addiction that TikTok can cause is harmful to the user of the app, it is what makes the company a lot of money | Since this app can be harmful to its users, I believe that it should be corrected and made to be not as addicting . | Virtual assistants might have female voices because they are perceived as more trustworthy, soothing and pleasant | Also, these voices might be used to attract male audiences | In these ways, this is definitely good business and had definitely helped these companies that create these virtual assistants | I also don’t believe that the overuse of female voices in virtual assistants is harmful | . Are HP Computers Racist? . I believe that the owner of the computer did not think this was intentional. I hypothesize that this happened with improper testing. I think that the majority of the testers of the camera were white and the camera wasn’t tested by enough darker people to recognize them as people. To produce a better outcome, a wider range of people should be tested, so the camera would be able to detect everyone. It’s imperative that this problem is corrected because this can cause a lot of problems and harm. It can even be emotionally hurtful as some people might question their humanity. . Big Idea 5.4 Crowdsourcing . What is Crowdsourcing? . Crowdsourcing is the practice of a lot of different people contributing information for a task or project | An example of crowdsourcing is different people contributing different information that comes together in a Wikipedia page | . Evidence of Crowdsourcing . Wikipedia is a major example of something that uses crowdsourcing Wikipedia works with many people contributing information on a single topic and this information coming together to form an article | Sometimes this information can be inaccurate because even people who are inexperienced and not credible can add information to the page | . | For crypto currency, the 3 step validation of exchanges of money provided by 3 different miners is an example of crowdsourcing | For COVID data, different places can contribute their data about all the different aspects of this topic | . Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing . I mostly use APIs from RapidAPI because we learned about that last trimester. We learned about an API that contained COVID data and we learned how to convert the data into json format. For this project, I have also used 2 APIs (one to convert a city’s name to its latitude and longitude coordinates and the other to use the latitude and longitude coordinates to find the nearest airport). In this project, I learned how to parse through the 2 APIs to get the data I am interested in. . With Github, we can see other student’s projects and see how they did certain things. For example, if someone highlighted something in their blog and I wanted to know how they did it, I could find their blog on Github and see how they did it. With this, it’s possible to not only learn from the internet, but from other students as well. . 5.4 Hacks . 1. CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . A crowdsourcing idea that we can use for CSP could be creating a big project with everyone inputting their own features. Since everyone in CSP know how to code at least something, we would be able to get many inputs and the project would come together well. Also, if people need help with the part of the project they are working on, they can ask another student for help. For our project, we can ask people about some buildings they want to visit so we can include them in our list of famous building and descriptions for them. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? | The previous crowdsourcing project I mentioned probably wouldn’t be better with the entire school, because inexperienced people might contribute work that makes the project worse. It’s better for people who know what they are doing to contribute rather than people who don’t. Since the idea I wrote about in the first question isn’t related to CSP, we can ask anyone from Del Norte about famous building they want to visit. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. | At Night at the Museum, all of the pieces of our project would have come together. We can ask someone to input their current location and where they want to visit (based on the location of the building they want to visit). Then, with the Google API, we can show them their current location and their destination on a map. This will probably impress the teachers during finals week. . Big Ideas 5.5 and 5.6: . 5.5 Hacks . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. | Since public repositories on GitHub are often used for sharing open source software, GitHub displays license information to help users get information about open source licenses and the projects that use them. It’s important for anyone who is creating a public repo to always update the right license. There are many different license types listed. Some examples include: Academic Free License v3.0, Apache license 2.0, GNU General Public License, Open Software License 3.0. . In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. | I understand the need for patents and intellectual property rights - companies spend years and a lot of money on research and development to come out with products and solutions. The companies need to pay the salary to their employees as well as turn a profit - so protecting their work with royalty is necessary. . Open Source community is extremely vital for us to be able to build on top of each other’s work. This way everyone doesn’t need to re-invent what has already been thought of and developed. It helps students like me, other software developers who don’t have a lot of resources, etc. I would also like to be a contributor to the open source community in the future. . I learnt about so many different type of licensing options in this class - some which are completely open to use and distribute, others which have restrictions on derivative work, and so on. Common permissive licenses include the MIT License, Apache License, and BSD License. Popular copyleft ( method using which you can modify the software or documentation and distribute it back to the open-source community ) licenses include the GNU (General Public License) and the Mozilla Public License. . Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. | My personal blog used the Apache license 2.0 license. I was able to figure this out because it’s the information about which license my blog is using is located in the “LICENSE” file. It seems that this is the default license used. . In our CPT project, I have added a new LICENSE file and I selected MIT as the license. I looked on the internet and found that MIT is the most popular license used on GitHub. It is very simple and it gives users express permission to reuse code for any purposes. . 5.6 Hacks . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. | In my personal blog fastpages project, PII such as my name, school, and classes I am taking are listed. In our group project (RECS), the only example of PII is our names. These examples of PII are probably won’t cause me any harm if others find this information. . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? | I don’t share a lot about my PII. I don’t use social media and therefore don’t share any personal information to the public. However, later on I might create social media account, but I will make sure not to publicize any information about myself that I wouldn’t want people to find out (like my phone number, address, and date of birth). . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. | Good passwords are long and include different cases of characters, numbers, and symbols to ensure that the password can’t be cracked easily. It’s best to use a computer generated password (softwares such as Keychain) because these are designed to be strong. Sometimes multi - factor authentication is used to verify your identity by using multiple methods of authentication (such as a passcode, a key, a fingerprint). . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. | Symmetric encryption is when one key is used to encrypt something and decrypt it. Some examples of these are AES, DES, and 3DES. Asymmetric encryption allows users to encrypt information using shared keys. Some examples of asymmetric encryption are RSA and DSS. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. | An example of encryption we used in AWS deployment is AES-256. This is another example of symmetric encryption that uses a 256-bit secret key for encryption and decryption . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. | Personally, I haven’t fallen victim to any phishing schemes. However, I have seen several phishing emails claiming - that I have won a contest and I need to enter my information to collect the prize money, or that there is a package waiting for me which I never ordered, or that my insurance has expired and I need to renew it. It is important that we scan the emails and the address it is being sent from before clicking any links or giving out any PII in such links. .",

Just like last few performance task scoring assignments, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I’ve gotten used to grading the programs based on College Board’s criteria. After comparing , I realized that I was way more lenient with my grading than College Board. Just like with the other performance task scoring assignments, I became a lot more familiar with the different categories College Board uses to grade the performance tasks. I also understand that when you write your written response, make your program, and create your video, you have to pay a lot of attention to detail and make sure you’re meeting all the criteria. With the 3 create performance task grading assignments I have completed, I have a greater understanding of what it takes to create a program, written response, and videos that meet College Board’s criteria. .",

Just like last time, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I was surprised with how College Board decided to grade some of the categories and that their scoring different from mine at times. With this assignment, I think I learned a lot about the different categories College Board uses to grade the performance tasks. Also, I came to realize that it takes a lot of work to grade the performance tasks because one small error can result in a 0. This made it challenging to figure out whether the category should receive a 0 or a 1. With the 2 create performance task grading assignments I have completed, I have a greater understanding of what it takes to fulfill the requirements of each category and how selective College Board is with their grading. .",

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter).

Reflection . Overall, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. After looking at these performance tasks and seeing how College Board graded them with their rubric, I can see how careful you have to be about meeting each and every requirement on the rubric. Even if you miss one small thing, you won’t receive any credit for the category. Knowing this, I will be sure to review the rubric many times to make sure my performance task has everything it needs to score well. I also wanted to mention that I think that both of these examples were really well made. .",

            "content": "(1) Reflection . Thorough notes or summary that reflects understanding of today&#39;s lesson. . I learned many things from this lesson on sections 14-15. I learned about how libraries make coding more efficient because prewritten code can be used to simplify a program. I also learned about how procedures can be created so you don&#39;t have to use a series of commands to do something every time. For example, creating a procedure for moving a robot backwards and using it when necessary is much more efficient that using something like &quot;rotate right, rotate right, move forward&quot; every time you want to make the robot move backwards. I learned about how documentation gives an explanation of what a certain procedure does. Lastly, I learned about the random library and all of its functions that allows us to randomly generate values in different ways. . Notes . Libraries contain prewritten code that can be used by programmers | Programmers use libraries to make their code more efficient and easier to follow | Documentation allows for programmers to understand what each procedure or function does | An API is a way for computer programs to communicate with each other and access information | The random library is an example of a library that allows you to use different functions that allow you to generate random values | Examples of functions present in the random library: random.randint(a,b): chooses a random integer between a and b (inclusive) | random.choice(list): chooses a random element from a list | random.shuffle(list): randomly rearranges the elements in a list | random.randrange(start, stop, step): similar to random.randint with the minimum and maximum values, but random.randrange needs a &quot;step&quot; parameter which takes in the increment by which the possible values increases by (default increment value of 1) | . | . (2) Multiple Choice . What does the random(a,b) function generate? | A. A random integer from a to be exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. . ☆ My answer: The answer is choice B because this function will randomly generate an integer from a to b (including the values a and b). . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . ☆ My answer: The correct answer is choice A. This is because x is the starting or minimum value, y is the stopping or maximum value, and z is the step or value that the possible integers increment by. . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . ☆ My answer: The answer to this question is A because all of the other functions exist. The function random.random generates a random float between 0 and 1. The function random.shuffle randomly rearranges the elements of the list it takes in. Lastly, random.randint generates a random integer. . (3) Short Answer Questions . What is the advantage of using libraries? | ☆ My answer: Using libraries is advantageous because they contain prewritten code that can be used by programmers to make their code more efficient and easier to follow. . Write a thorough documentation of the following code. | import random names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) num_items = len(names) random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . Sachit is going to buy the meal today! . Documentation: The input() function prompts the user with a statement that the user needs to respond to. In this case, the user is prompted to enter everybody&#39;s names. The split() function will separate the names with commas. The len() function is used to find the length of the list of names. The random.randint() is used to generate a number from (representing index of the list) 0 to the length of the list minus 1. The person who will pay is selected using the randomly generated index of the list. The final print statement will print the person selected and states that they will buy the meal. . (4) Coding Challenges! . REQUIRED: Create programs in python to complete the two task&lt;/p&gt; Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names | &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; import random names = [&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Emma&quot;, &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot;, &quot;Henry&quot;, &quot;Noah&quot;, &quot;Benjamin&quot;, &quot;Luna&quot;, &quot;Christopher&quot;, &quot;Jayden&quot;, &quot;Lucas&quot;, &quot;Elijah&quot;, &quot;Sophia&quot;, &quot;Abigail&quot;, &quot;Charlotte&quot;, &quot;Mason&quot;] selected = [] checkDuplicates = [] # to make sure there aren&#39;t any duplicate names generated for i in range(5): generated = random.choice(names) while generated in checkDuplicates: a = random.choice(names) checkDuplicates.append(generated) selected.append(generated) print(&quot;5 Random Names:&quot;) for name in selected: print(name) . 5 Random Names: Elijah Sophia Charlotte Jayden Abigail . Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice (6 sides); the player with the greater sum wins | import random # players start with 0 points before rolling player1 = 0 player2 = 0 #rolls for player1: roll1 = random.randint(1,6) roll2 = random.randint(1,6) player1sum = roll1 + roll2 print(&quot;Player 1 Sum: &quot; + str(player1sum)) #rolls for player2: roll1 = random.randint(1,6) roll2 = random.randint(1,6) player2sum = roll1 + roll2 print(&quot;Player 2 Sum: &quot; + str(player2sum)) #Displaying which player is the winner: if player1sum &gt; player2sum: print(&quot;Player 1 is the winner!&quot;) elif player1sum &lt; player2sum: print(&quot;Player 2 is the winner!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Both players have tied!&quot;) . Player 1 Sum: 7 Player 2 Sum: 8 Player 2 is the winner! . Extra Credit . Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: . No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (handdrawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . import random directions = [&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] initialDirection = random.choice(directions) # randomly chooses direction print(&quot;Initial Direction: &quot; + initialDirection) initialPosition = random.randint(1,25) # integer generated represents square number print(&quot;Initial Position: &quot; + str(initialPosition)) goalPosition = random.randint(1,25) while goalPosition == initialPosition: # while loops ensures initial position can&#39;t be same as goal position goalPosition = random.randint(1,25) print(&quot;Goal Position: &quot; + str(goalPosition)) obstacles = [] # list that will hold all obstacle square numbers checkDuplicates = [] for i in range(12): # generates 12 obstacles a = random.randint(1,25) while a in checkDuplicates: # makes sure a is not already present in list to ensure unique obstacle squares a = random.randint(1,25) while a == initialPosition or a == goalPosition: # makes sure a is not equal to initial or goal squares a = random.randint(1,25) checkDuplicates.append(a) obstacles.append(a) print(&quot;Location of Obstacles: &quot; + str(obstacles)) . Initial Direction: up Initial Position: 5 Goal Position: 9 Location of Obstacles: [15, 8, 12, 24, 20, 21, 19, 18, 3, 1, 2, 4] . Robot Course for Code Above . &lt;/div&gt; .",

            "content": "Notes: . An algorithm can be made more efficient by reducing the number of steps needed to accomplish the task This is why different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies | . | A way to informally measure an algorithm&#39;s efficiency is by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes | Approximate solutions are found when problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficient algorithm for solving them | It is possible for there to be some solutions to an input of an undecidable problem | . Vocab: . Four Types of Algorithms: 1 Step: An integer being multiplied by a variable | 2 Step: An integer to the power of the variable | 3 Step: A variable multiplied by an integer, all raised to the power of 2 | 4 Step: A variable factorial | . | Decidable Problems: Problems for which algorithms could be written to solve/produce a correct output for all inputs. | Undecidable Problems: Problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer or a solution | Constant Time: Algorithm that always takes a fixed number of steps, no matter how large the input size increases | Linear Time: Algorithm in which the number of steps increases in direct proportion to the input size | Quadratic Time: Algorithm where the number of steps increase in proportion to the input size squared | Exponential Time: Algorithm where the number of steps increases faster than a polynomial function of the input size | Polynomial Time: Any run time that does not increase faster than n^k | Superpolynomial Time: Any run time that does increase faster than n^k | Reasonable Time: Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or lower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) | Unreasonable Time: Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies | . HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable Problem: Decidable problems are problems for which algorithms can be written to produce an output for all possible inputs. . Example: . a = True if a == True: print(&quot;hello&quot;) else: print(&quot;bye&quot;) . hello . Undecidable Problem: Undecidable problems are problems for which no algorithm can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer. It is possible for there to be some algorithmic solutions for some inputs of an undecidable problem. . Example (Halting Problem): . def haltingProblem(): a = 0 x = 1 while a != 1: x = x + 1 print(x) haltingProblem() . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . ☆ My answer: The correct answer is C. This is because a 3 step algorithm needs to have an integer variable multiplied by another integer which is all raised to the power of 2 and (3 x 8)^2 meets these requirements. . HACK 3: Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . Rewritten Code: . function peak_finder(list) { var peak = list[0]; for (i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i ++) { if (list[i] &gt; peak) { var peak = list[i]; } } return peak; # after all comparisons, returns highest value in list } var data = [5, 2, 3, 4, 9]; console.log(peak_finder(data)); # prints highest number in list (9) . Hack 3 Reflection: . This hack was a little confusing because I wasn&#39;t sure how to use binary search to make the code more efficient. Instead, since I&#39;m pretty sure the code is supposed to find the highest number in a list, I made code that compares elements in the list to each other to determine the highest value in the list. . HACK 4: Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . Intead of writing my own code to sort the list, I can use the sort function to make the code more efficient: . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] data.sort() # sort function orders the data from least to greatest print(&quot;Sorted List:&quot;, data) . Sorted List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] .

Code snippet 4 is also correct because it assigns each carbon footprint to a variable which are then added together to get the total carbon footprint. . 3.12 Hacks Part 2 . Problem 1: . Answer: The value of a is 729. . First, the value of b is found by multiplying 9 and 9 which is 81. Next, the value of a is found by multiply the value of b and c together which is 81 x 9 which is 729. . Problem 2: . “cost ⟵ 173 tax - 10%” was written poorly and was very confusing. At first I thought cost was assigned to the entire value on the right. But after a long time of getting confused, I realized cost was assigned to 173 and tax was assigned to 10%. . Answer: The cost is 190.3 . First, we know that temp is 100 + percentTaxed which is 110. Next, temp is assigned to temp/100 which is 110/100 which is 1.1. Lastly, cost is equal to the previously given value of cost multiplied by the new value for temp which gives us a value of 190.3 (173 x 1.1) for cost. . Problem 3: . Answer: The temperature in celsius is about 39.4 degrees Celsius. . First, Celsius is set to the value of temperature - 32 which is 71. Next, Celsius is set to the value of Celsius x 5/9 which is about 39.4. . 3.13 Hacks Parts 1 and 2 . Problem 1: . PROCEDURE CurrentHighest(currentrbyards, totalGames, toprbyardspg) { . currentrbyardspg &lt;– currentrbyards/totalGames . IF currentrbyardspg &gt; toprbyardspg { . toprbyardspg &lt;– currentrbyardspg . } . return(toprbyardspg) . } . DISPLAY(CurrentHighest(1260, 12, 100)) . Problem 2: .

Question 5 . Since this list is already ordered from least to greatest, we can skip this step. To find the number 69 in the list in question 4, we would first start by finding the middle element. Since there are an even number of elements in this list, there would be no middle element, so we would use the next element from the middle of the list which in this case would be 6. Since 6 is less than 69, we know that 69 is in the second half of the list with all the numbers greater than 6. Since the middle element of this half is 11 and is less than 69, we know that the number 69 is in the part of the list after the element 11. Since there is only one element in this part of the list, we know that this element is 69 and we have found the desired value 69. . Question 6 . Diagram . Question 7 . Ordered List: [“store”,”Market”,”Walmart”,Target”,”Ralphs”] . Arranging them in alphabetical order was the best way I could think of to get the list ready for binary search. I first thought of ordering them by length of each string, but then I realized this wouldn&#39;t work because some of the strings have the same length. . Question 8 . Binary search is more efficient than sequential search because binary search removes half the elements every time which is very effective in pinpointing exactly where the desired element is. Sequential is usually less efficient because if the desired element is towards the end of the list or the list is very long, all the previous elements would have to be checked before reaching the desired element. Therefore, sequential search usually takes more checks to reach the desired value than binary search. . Question 9 . Binary Search Tree . If we are searching for the value 36, this will take 2 checks because the first middle index will be found to be 3 because (1+5)/2 = 3. Next the second middle index will be found to be 2 because (1+3)/2 = 2. Since index 2 is the value 36, 36 will be found on the second check. .",

I still don’t understand why the answer to this question is “FOR loops” because since the loop will iterate over a list until the user inputs ‘quit’, this represents a while loop because the loop ends when a condition is met.

Additionally, blog about any missed questions, or what you learned from this lesson. . 3.5 Hacks . Binary Practice . Using psuedocode operators determine if the statements are true or false. The number type will be indicated in parentheses. . 1. 90(D) = 1000(B) . A. True | B. False | . ☆ My answer: 1000(B) = 8(D) ≠ 90(D). Since the 2 values aren&#39;t equal to each other, the answer is false. . 2. 10(D) ≠ 0110(B) . A. True | B. False | . ☆ My answer: 0110(B) = 6(D) ≠ 10(D). Since the 2 values aren&#39;t equal to each other, the answer is true because the question is asking if they aren&#39;t equal to each other. . 3. 56(D) ≥ 111000(B) . A. True | B. False | . ☆ My answer: 111000(B) = (8 + 16 + 32)(D) = 56(D) ≤ 56(D). Since this comparison can be satisfied when the 2 values are equal to each other (because 56(D) has to be greater than or equal to 111000(B)), the answer is true. . 3. 99(D) &lt; 1110011(B) . A. True | B. False | . ☆ My answer: 1110011(B) = (1 + 2 + 16 + 32 + 64)(D) = 115(D) &gt; 99(D). Since 1110011(B) is indeed greater than 99(D), the answer is true. .

The point of this event is for people to see how hard the students worked on their projects and enjoy looking at these projects. . The first class I explored was 3D animation. The projects displayed where scenes created by students related to donuts. The requirement for this project was that every image had to contain a donut in some way. The image I found most fascinating was the holographic donut. Here is a picture of it: . . There were also many other good projects, but there weren’t quite as good as the holographic donut. Here is another cool project that I saw: . . Another class I went to was studio art. There were many different paintings and art pieces plastered against the walls of the class. As I walked around the classroom looking at all the paintings, I could tell that every student has put in a lot of effort into their project. Here are some paintings I found interesting: . . Next, I went to the ceramics classroom to see what students in that class created. I saw many unique and interesting projects, but the one that intrigued me the most was this octopus: . . Lastly, I also was able to ask another group about what their project is about and how it works. The Tetris game works by using a grid with each tile being assigned to the same number value. As the Tetris block moves down the grid, arrow keys are used to move the block left and right, or the block is rotated, the blocks on the grid that the Tetris block occupies changes to a different number highlighting the Tetris block as it moves. . . Goals for Next Trimester . I want to learn about many new things that seem interesting to me. | I want to be more productive with my work during class time. | I want to be able to ask more questions in class to get my questions clarified. | I want to participate in more extra credit opportunities. | .",

When I ran this command, I received a parsing error which means that the software can’t understand what I’m trying to do. This means that there is either something wrong with my formatting or the code. . Checking for Formatting Issues: . I searched up the error I received and read through a few forums on Stack Overflow. While reading through the comments, I noticed that most people were receiving the parsing error because they had unnecessary spaces in their code. . A few Methods I used to Check for any Unnecessary Spaces: . I even ran my code through a YAML validator to make sure there weren’t any mistakes in my code that violate syntax or incorrect indentations. . I even used the vi command to open a text editor. After creating it, I typed so I could see if there are any spaces that need to be removed. However, there weren’t any unnecessary spaces in the code. . Checking for Mistakes in my Code: . To check for mistakes in my code, I made sure to copy the correct template for the code and change the things that were needed to be changed. I changed the port number, the image name, and I added the directory to my project. I also checked with a few friends to make sure I wasn’t missing anything. . Asking Teacher for Help: . When I asked Mr Yeung for help, he told me to use the “sudo nano config.yml” command to edit the config.yml file and fix any problems in the code without using VSCode. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get my problem resolved because class was ending and he needed to leave. .",

First, an idea is formed The program idea has a purpose and will be programmed for that specific purpose | A plan is created and specific steps are followed | Sometimes the development is exploratory and steps are dictated by what happens | . | Developers need to investigate the problem/purpose and reflect upon it Developers must follow requirements and constraints of the program and also the users interests with the program | Developers can investigate through the use of surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming, storyboarding the program, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and developing a testing strategy | Developers decide on program requirements that describe how the program should behave and includes a list of user interactions | Developers will test small parts (modules) of the program to make sure they are working before putting them together | Developers test the program at the micro (individual components) and macro (individual components working together as intended) levels | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection | . How is a Program Developed (Video 2)? . Programs are usually developed by teams of people so many inputs and ideas can be provided. Also different people are good at different tasks making team development the obvious choice of development. | Individuals/groups work on different functional components | Every member of the project needs to receive credit for their contributions Their names and contributions must be written in the documentation of the program | . | Many programs give credit through the use of comments because this makes it easy to find out and contact people in charge of a specific part of the code when there is a bug in that code segment | Many times developers use code segments, procedures, and algorithms that are written by people that are not involved in the project just so they don’t have to figure out how to do it themselves (think “there’s no point in reinventing the wheel”) The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used | . | . Documentation . Programmers create program documentation to describe the overall program, list program specifications, describe parts of the program, and list contributors/authors of the program | Documentation throughout development of the program: At the beginning: list specifications | During: keep track of process | After: explain the overall process | Documentation throughout the development can improve the efficiency of the programming process, programmers’ ability to test and refine the program, and programmers’ response to bugs | . | .

Even though students at Yale are very privileged to be at a place like Yale, they are so stressed and filled with anxiety because they are overwhelmed and incredibly busy all the time. | Here are some ways that Yale students are negatively by stress: Students are so stressed that they can’t make use of all the good opportunities presented to them. | Students are too stressed to enjoy the small pleasures and do things that students love(ex: reading a book). | . | . College Student Mental Health Statistics (2009 Study) . 40% of college students report more than the average level of stress | About 1/3 of students report being so depressed that it’s difficult to function | Over 40% often feel hopeless | A little under 50% say they experience overwhelming anxiety | Over 50% report often feeling very lonely | Over 80% say they fell overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do every day | . Psychology and the Good Life Class . Laurie Santos created this course to help students understand and deal with stress and anxiety in college | There were two parts to the Psychology and the Good Life Course: Understanding positive psychology and how to make the positive changes in your life | Actually practicing the good habits (this is important because it’s one thing to understand what you should be doing to improve your mental health, but it’s another to actually implement the key ideas into your own life) | . | This course performed so well that it became the most popular course at Yale. The reason why this course performed so well was because many students were having trouble dealing with their stress and anxiety | . | Important insights that students can take away from the course: Your level of well being can be improved through the correct practices and measures taken to improve it. | We think that our life circumstances (such as occupation and salary) matter a lot, but they don’t matter nearly as much as we think | Sleep is very important for brain development and well being (and high school and college students aren’t getting enough) | It’s important to be aware of the present moment because it enables you to notice and enjoy the good things in your life.

            "content": "Program Purpose and Function . An idea I came up with for the Create Performance Task project is a Math Quiz game. In this game there will be three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. There will be a random math question (based on difficulty selected) shown at the top of the screen. Below the question, there will be many boxes (one of them containing the answer) scattered across the screen. Every time you select the correct answer, you get 1000 points (for getting the question right) and the screen changes to show the next question. You can get the questions wrong infinite times, but each time you select and incorrect answer, your total score will decrease by 100 points. There will be a timer in the corner of the screen showing the amount of time left until the game ends. The goal of the game is to get the most points that you can. . Data Abstraction . Many variables will be used to store different values in the program. Some variables that will be very useful are a variable for the score, a variable for the timer, variables for the answers scattered across the screen, and variables for the lists for each difficulty. . Managing Complexity . To manage the complexity of my code, I will add the questions into a list and randomly generate questions from the list. There will be a list for each difficulty level. . Procedural Abstraction . To manage the difficulty, there will be three different buttons to select how hard the user wants the quiz to be. The list that will be accessed during the quiz depends on the difficulty level selected. For example, if easy mode is selected, questions from the list containing the easy mode questions will be asked. . Algorithm Implementation . A way I can implement an algorithm is by including a percent representing how many questions the user got correct without selecting an incorrect answer. . Testing . To test the project, I will run all three difficult modes and test whether the point system works. I will also make sure that the game ends and displays the final score when the timer ends. .",

Since you are given an unlimited number of attempts, there is no score given after the quiz is completed. When an incorrect answer is chosen, the user will be taken to a screen telling them they got the question incorrect and they need to try again. When the correct answer is chosen, the user will be taken to a screen telling them they got the question correct and they will proceed to the next question. Once all the questions have been answered correctly, the user will be taken to the final screen telling them they have have completed the quiz. . Successes . I had many successes while making my animal quiz. One success that I had was that I was able to add many images that related to the questions. These images will not only add more to my quiz, but they also make the quiz more entertaining. Another success I had was using buttons to allow the user to advance through the quiz. I like the use of buttons because they are a much cleaner way of selecting an answer than just clicking an image (method used in teacher’s example). . Challenges . Not only did I have many successes, but I also had a few challenges while making the quiz. My biggest challenge was trying to figure out how I should make my incorrect and correct systems. Finally, I decided to make incorrect and correct screens for each question that appeared depending on whether the user gets the question correct or incorrect. Another challenge that I had was with finding images with a transparent background. After watching a video explaining how to find images with transparent backgrounds on Google, I was able to good images that worked well with my quiz. . Discoveries . Throughout my journey of creating my first quiz with JavaScript, I made many discoveries. One discovery I made was that you can personalize your quiz by changing the theme of it. I selected Under the Sea” as my theme. Another discovery that I made was that buttons can be used to progress through different screens.

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .

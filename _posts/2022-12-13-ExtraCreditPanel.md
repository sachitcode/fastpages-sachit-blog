### Reflection:

From the speakers Kathyleen Beveridge and Kris Porter I learned a lot about their background, what areas of tech they specialize in, and what they've learned over the years of working in tech. I learned that as a DevOps engineer, Kris porter focuses on deploying the software to the public and making updates when problems arise or when improvements can be made. I also learned about how Kathyleen Beveridge was responsible for organizing the project and making sure everything done meets the criteria and constraints as project management. Overall, I learned a lot about what working in a tech related job is really about.

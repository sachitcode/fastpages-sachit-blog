### My experience at Night at the Museum

What is Night of the Museum?: Night at the museum is a day where art pieces from different art classes are presented for people to see and admire. The point of this event is for people to see how hard the students worked on their projects and enjoy looking at these projects.

The first class I explored was 3D animation. The projects displayed where scenes created by students related to donuts. The requirement for this project was that every image had to contain a donut in some way. The image I found most fascinating was the holographic donut. Here is a picture of it:

There were also many other good projects, but there weren't quite as good as the holographic donut. Here is another cool project that I saw:

Another class I went to was studio art. There were many different paintings and art pieces plastered against the walls of the class. As I walked around the classroom looking at all the paintings, I could tell that every student has put in a lot of effort into their project. Here are some paintings I found interesting:

Next, I went to the ceramics classroom to see what students in that class created. I saw many unique and interesting projects, but the one that intrigued me the most was this octopus:

Lastly, I also was able to ask another group about what their project is about and how it works. The Tetris game works by using a grid with each tile being assigned to the same number value. As the Tetris block moves down the grid, arrow keys are used to move the block left and right, or the block is rotated, the blocks on the grid that the Tetris block occupies changes to a different number highlighting the Tetris block as it moves.

### Goals for Next Trimester

- I want to learn about many new things that seem interesting to me.
- I want to be more productive with my work during class time.
- I want to be able to ask more questions in class to get my questions clarified.
- I want to participate in more extra credit opportunities.

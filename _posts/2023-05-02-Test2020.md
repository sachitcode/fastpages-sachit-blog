### Introduction: 

In this practice exam, I got a score of 65/67 questions correct. This blog will contain the mistakes I made while taking this test, the correct answers to the questions I got wrong, what I learned from reviewing the correct answers, and a reflection which highlights what I learned from this test. The following image shows the amount of time it took for me to complete this test.

### Weird Questions:

There were a few questions that were confusing and I had to search up, but they made more sense after I looked them up.

### Question 9:

I got this question wrong because I read the "1MB to 10MB" as just 1MB. With this misunderstanding, it makes sense that I got the question wrong. Now I understand why my answer is incorrect and College Board's answer makes total sense. The answer is B because this will encompass the section that I thought was part of answer A which is over 75%.

### Question 14:

The first step for this question has to be removing the duplicate numbers from each list. The next step has to be combining the 2 lists. The next step has to be removing the duplicate numbers from the combined list. Finally, the last step has to be determining the number of elements in this combined list to find the number of unique numbers that are in both lists. This is why the answer is D.

### Reflection:

**What I Did Well:**

I was able to do most of them by myself and get them right. Most of the questions were doable and I was able to get them right.

**What I Need to Work On:**

There were still a few questions I had to search up because they were a little confusing. Also, I still need to work on completing the questions in time. If I continue to work through the questions at this pace, I won't be able to finish all of the questions on the AP exam.

**Overall**

Overall, I think I did pretty well and the most important thing I need to work on before the AP test is my timing.
